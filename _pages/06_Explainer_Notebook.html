<p><h1 align = "center"> 1. Motivation </h1>
Game Of Thrones is a very popular series, and achieved the status of being the most watched series to date. The series consist of multiple characters, allegiances, religions, locations and at the same time all these stories play out at the same time. Which makes the information and storytelling at some point quite overwhelming - do all of these characters have a pattern in how they act? Are there any pattern in how their story play out? Could we forecast these events?</p>
<p>We wish to dig into these massive amounts of informations of each character to investigate if we could unveil any underlying pattern which could help all the Game Of Thrones fans understand the story even better. This would include investigation of network patterns, but also if we could find the most important character in each season, and overall in the series. Also see if we can find any underying communities and thereby see if we can decoded the underlying pattern.</p>
<h2 align = "center">1.1 What is your dataset? </h2><p>Our main dataset is from <a href="https://gameofthrones.fandom.com/wiki/Game_of_Thrones_Wiki">The Game Of Thrones wiki-page</a>, where we have extracted the character pages for all characters present in the Game Of Thrones series. This dataset are restricted to only contain the characters that are stated on the Wiki-page, and when this is compared with the number of characters from the book, the data amount in number of characters are quite small.</p>
<p>The data for each character are both extracted as a total amount of data across all seasons ie. all the data from each character page, but also based on each season. From the character page it some basic attributes was extracted: allegiance, religion, culture, appearances, status and what other characters the given character were linked to, and how often these were linked. The thumbnail image was also extracted for later visualization, and lastly the text was cleaned for the purpose of text analysis later on.</p>
<p>As the wiki-pages are written by other people this could effect the sentiment of the character pages, therefore it was also decided to include an extra data source namely the character dialogoues. A data-source containing clean transcripts from all the seasons and episodes was used, so no data cleaning was needed here besides excluding all the dialogoue of characters that was not found through the wiki-page data.</p>
<p>Lastly, ratings and reviews from IMDB was used for each episode, as it was wished to compare this with the dialogoue. This was found by the use of a python package, which did extract data from IMDB. We did further investigate the possibility to scrape the IMDB webpage for reviews, but later it was found that this was not allowed and therefore we did not further pursue this opportunity.</p>
<h2 align = "center">1.2 Why did you choose this/these particular dataset(s)? </h2><p>The dataset from the Game of Thrones wikipage, was used as this could both deliver information about each character ie. some of their general attributes but also text relating to interactions of the characters but also words describing each character. This could help us understand the interactions between all characters, and hopefully help us understand some of the underlying patterns in the series.</p>
<p>We could investigate the network properties of the series both on an overall level across all seasons but also in each season. Through this we could make an analysis of each season, and investigate how this developed through each season. By investigation of words describing each character, and on the basis of their attributes eg. allegiance, we would perform text and sentiment analysis to see if we could understand the grouping.</p>
<p>As the sentiment of the character pages could be biased by the writer of the page we wanted to find the root source namely the transcripts from the series, and therefore we did add the dialogoue of all the characters as an second data source. This was done as we thought this could add extra valuable information to understand how the characters was feeling, and how this further was grouped.</p>
<p>Lastly, we added the ratings from IMDB to see if the reviewers was affected by the general mood in the series.</p>
<h2 align = "center">1.3 What was your goal for the end user's experience? </h2><p>The goal of the website is to present nice interactive visualizations that engage the user to explore the data and the Game Of Thrones series. Further, the site should be easy to grasp and understandable also for people without the theoretical knowledge learned in the course. The website contains results presented in different visualizations and tables that the user can dive into, and should be tempted to dive deeper into the analysis and the results. The site should be engaging, and it should not be necessary to visit the site for hours in order to get any insights, though this should be an opportunity.</p>
<p>The website should let the end user explore the complex character interactions from the Game Of Thrones series, and let the user understand some of these patterns, which is explored both through network analysis, text analysis and sentiment analysis. The user should understand which characters are the most important characters in the series but also in each season, and further explore these characters properties. This could include words they use, how the characters feel and who they interact with. The user should feel the urge to dive deeper into this, and should feel confident in what the data contains and can be used for.</p>

<h1 align= "center"> 4. Discussion </h1><p>Our primary data source were the wiki-pages, and this proved to be a time consuming task to extract data from, due to a lot of human incosistencies and errors. This included multiple re-iterations of the regular expressions used to extract both character links, but also the attributes for each character. We did in the end after numerous attempts end up with a approach that appears to be mostly error free (we might find some when digging more into this), so we ended up with clean data. We did also discover that the information present for each character was very diverse and characters did contain different amount and quality of information, which needed to be handled.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the project we wished to add all the reviews from IMDB, which we in the beginning approached with web-scraping and used quite some time to set scripts and functions up to do this, but learned after some research that this was not allowed. We did therefore approach this by using a bult-in package in Python to extract these, but this showed to only extract 25 reviews pr. episode. After further analysis this showed not be enough as eg. the reviews and ratings not always appeared to be matching very well. We did therefore drop to use the reviews in this project, but we still think it could be interesting to investigate how sentiment of the reviews developed as the series progresses and compare this with the state of the (main) characters. Do we change our state of mood when the characters? Humans are said to mirror other humans, so this would be intersting to dive into.</p>
<p>We especially think that our interactive visualization apps ie. the network app that enables the user to investigate the interactions season by season but also across the whole story are went very well. This app contains enormous amount of information as one can get information about each character including the attributes, frequent used words, image and a link to the character page on the wiki-page. Further, the user can overlay the network with different attributes, and investigate patterns. At the same time we think the visualization are easy to understand without diving deep into the information.</p>
<p>The app describing the degrees and closeness centrality is also an element that we are proud of, as this can in an easy to grasp approach show what are the main character in each season. Also we are very proud of the large functionalities of this app, as the user can sort and delete features.</p>

<h1 align = "center"> 5. Future Work </h1><p>The data did only contain 165 characters as the primary data source used for the character was from the Game Of Thrones wikipage, which did not contain all the characters from the books. It would be interesting to further investigate the characters, their interactions, and some of the underlying patterns as there yet are a lot to dive into. The data could be supplied with further data from the books which can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mmmarchetti/game-of-thrones-network-analysis/data">here</a>.</p>
<p>This extensive dataset could add further complexity to the network analysis, and further the dialogoues used in this project could suplement information of the dialogoue of the majority of these characters. The dialogoue dataset contains more than 800 characters, and supplying the to date analysis with these elements could hopefully help reveal further interesting patterns of the Game Of Thrones story.</p>
