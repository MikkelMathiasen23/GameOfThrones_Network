Grey Worm reports to Daenerys when an Unsullied soldier named [[White Rat]] is murdered by the [[Sons of the Harpy]], an insurgence group designed to remove Daenerys from power, while visiting a brothel. Later, he is approached by Missandei, who asks him why an Unsullied would want to visit a brothel. Grey Worm states that he does not know and leaves.<ref>"[[The Wars to Come]]"</ref>

[[File:Daario-and-greyworm-s5e2.jpg|thumb|Daario and Grey Worm track down a Son of the Harpy.]]
Grey Worm, with the help of [[Daario Naharis]], successfully track down and arrest a [[Son of the Harpy]] involved in White Rat's murder. Daario teaches Grey Worm that his Second Sons are less conspicuous than the Unsullied, making them much better at tracking down elusive Sons of the Harpy, since the Unsullied have virtually no fear and therefore forgot how to hide. After, Grey Worm is at Daenerys's council when they discuss what should be done with the Son of the Harpy who has been arrested. Later, he is present when [[Mossador]] is publicly executed for murdering the prisoner before a fair trial could take place. Grey Worm leads the Unsullied who escort Daenerys and her retainers away when a riot breaks out.<ref>"[[The House of Black and White]]"</ref>

Grey Worm is patrolling the streets of Meereen with other Unsullied when they discover that the Sons of the Harpy have murdered several individuals in broad daylight. The same [[Vala|prostitute]] that lured White Rat to his death directs Grey Worm and his Unsullied into a trap, where they are surrounded by Sons of the Harpy in a narrow passageway. The Unsullied are overwhelmed by their sheer numbers and are brutally murdered.<ref name=":1">"[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"</ref>

Grey Worm, despite taking numerous wounds, kills many of his attackers until he is the last Unsullied left alive. Just as the Sons of the Harpy close in around him, Ser [[Barristan Selmy]] arrives and manages to draw most of them away from Grey Worm. Barristan fights valiantly and kills most of the Sons, but ultimately suffers several mortal wounds. Before the last Son of the Harpy can cut Barristan's throat, Grey Worm manages to kill him before collapsing from his wounds next to the dead knight.<ref name=":1">"[[Sons of the Harpy (episode)|Sons of the Harpy]]"</ref>

Grey Worm ultimately survives his injuries, but is incapacitated and confined to a bed.<ref>"[[Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken]]"</ref> When he return to consciousness, he is accosted by Missandei, and admits to her his shame for letting Barristan Selmy die and failing Daenerys, and for feeling fear when he believed he was going to die, not for his life, but because of the possibility of never seeing her again. Missandei, touched by Grey Worm's words, kisses him.<ref>"[[Kill the Boy]]"</ref>

[[File:Scene in meereen-s5e10.jpg|thumb|Grey Worm is charged with enforcing Tyrion's rule over Meereen.]]
In the aftermath of the attack by the Sons of the Harpy at [[Daznak's Pit]] and Daenerys' disappearance on Drogon, Missandei brings Grey Worm – still recovering from his injuries – to a meeting of Daenerys's advisors, which now includes [[Tyrion Lannister]]. They decide that Jorah (who had returned to the city with Tyrion) and Daario would find Daenerys and Tyrion would rule in Meereen in her stead. Grey Worm volunteers to help Jorah and Daario look for Daenerys, but they tell him to remain in the city with Missandei, as he is the only one who can lead the Unsullied in keeping the peace and enforcing Tyrion's rule over Meereen.<ref>"[[Mother's Mercy]]"</ref>
