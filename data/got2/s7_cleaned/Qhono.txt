Qhono successfully crossed the Narrow Sea with the rest of Daenerys's Dothraki. He is the senior bloodrider present when Jon Snow and Davos arrive on Dragonstone. At Missandei's prompting, Qhono confiscates their visitors' weapons and leads the way to Daenerys's throne room. When Jon moves too close to his khaleesi, Qhono moves into a defensive position as a warning. When Daenerys cuts the meeting short, she gives a long list of orders to Qhono, presumably regarding how Jon and Ser Davos are to be treated.

Qhono is one of the guards that protect Tyrion as he watches on the Battle of the Goldroad. He tells Tyrion that his people do not fight well against the Dothraki. After the battle commences, he dresses in the looted attire of a Lannister general, and escorts Randyll and Dickon Tarly to their execution after they refuse to bend the knee.

After their return to Dragonstone, Qhono escorts Jorah Mormont to Daenerys, when he claimed to be a friend of hers. Later, he is present when Jon Snow and a group of allies depart Dragonstone for Eastwatch, hoping to capture a wight beyond the wall. The mission is successful, and House Lannister agrees to parley with House Targaryen in response to the Great War. Qhono is on hand during the Dragonpit Summit, acting as a guard of Daenerys's contingent.
