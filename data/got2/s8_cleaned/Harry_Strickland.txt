Strickland and the Golden Company are brought to Westeros by Euron Greyjoy. He oversees a division of the Golden Company on the Silence, Euron's flagship. He later meets with Queen Cersei in the throne room of the Red Keep alongside Euron. Strickland affirms the Golden Company's contract with Cersei, but reports although that they have brought their 18,000 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, their elephants are absent due to their inability to travel via sea voyage, much to Cersei's disappointment. Nonetheless, she welcomes him to King's Landing, after which he expresses placid eagerness to fight for her.

Strickland leads the Golden Company outside the gates of King's Landing at the beginning of the Battle of King's Landing, facing off against Jon Snow, Davos, Tyrion, and their armies outside the gates. However, Daenerys arrives with Drogon and burns through the city's walls and the Golden Company, knocking Strickland off his horse. Strickland attempts to run back into the city, but is skewered through the back by Grey Worm while the Targaryen, Stark, and Arryn forces charge into the city.
