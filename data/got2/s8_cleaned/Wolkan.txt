Wolkan is present when Jon Snow returns to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen and her army.
As Daenerys and Sansa talks about what could be done after the Great War ends, Wolkan walks in to inform the two about Theon Greyjoy's return to Winterfell.
Some time after Daenerys and Jon depart Winterfell to defeat Cersei Lannister, Wolkan informs Sansa and Brienne of Tarth about Euron’s ambush near Dragonstone, which results in the death of Daenerys’s dragon Rhaegal and the capture of Missandei.
After Daenerys is killed by Jon, and Bran is selected to rule over Westeros, Maester Wolkan crowns Sansa as Queen in the North.
