Qhono rides into Winterfell not far behind Daenerys and Jon Snow while marching the Targaryen army of Dothraki and Unsullied through winter town. He is also present when Tyrion announces that they must band together if they hope to defeat the Night King. Later, while in Winterfell, Qhono informs Daenerys that her dragons are eating only eighteen goats and eleven sheep.
Qhono attends the war council as Jon briefs everyone on the plan to defeat the army of the dead.
At the Battle of Winterfell, Qhono and the rest of the Dothraki army, under the command of Ser Jorah Mormont, are in formation to charge the army of the dead. Before the charge, the red priestess Melisandre casts a magical spell that lights the blades of all the Dothraki screamers. The Dothraki then charge towards the army of the dead but are ultimately slaughtered with only a few surviving. Qhono is among the casualties in this charge and becomes a wight. He is amongst the wights attacking Drogon, causing him to panic and throw Daenerys off his back. Qhono is ultimately destroyed with all the other wights when the Night King is destroyed by Arya Stark. His corpse is later burned in a mass funeral.
