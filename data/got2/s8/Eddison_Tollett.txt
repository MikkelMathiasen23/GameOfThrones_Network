Edd leads a group of [[Night's Watch]] members to [[Last Hearth]], looking for survivors after the [[wights|army of the dead]] [[Fall of Last Hearth|attack the castle]]. They nearly engage in a fight against [[Beric Dondarrion]] and [[Tormund]] before recognizing them. Edd and his group then explore the fallen castle and find the young [[Ned Umber]], who was killed by the [[White Walkers]] and pinned on the wall in the middle of a spiral symbol. As they discuss the need to reach [[Winterfell]], Ned is raised up as a wight before being destroyed by Beric's flaming sword.<ref>"[[Winterfell (episode)|Winterfell]]"</ref>

Edd makes it to Winterfell, where he is warmly greeted by Samwell and Jon. He tells them that he found Tormund and Beric at Last Hearth, informing Jon that the army of the dead will be upon them in a matter of hours. Edd later joins Jon and Samwell on the walls of Winterfell and engages the conversation with the usual Night's Watch phrase "''And now our watch begins''". After joking about how the fact that Samwell slain a White Walker and found a woman for himself seems like a sign of the end of the world, Edd recalls their fallen comrades of the Night's Watch and reminds that whoever survives last will have to burn the others' bodies.<ref>"[[A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms]]"</ref>

During the initial phase of the [[Battle of Winterfell (Great War)|Battle of Winterfell]], Edd is shocked, but not surprised, to see Samwell within the infantry, sarcastically asking after his absence. After the initial charge of [[Dothraki]] are killed by the army of the dead, Edd participates in the battle. After saving Sam from a wight, he is stabbed in the back by another, dying before Sam's eyes. Edd's corpse is then reanimated by the Night King along with others who did not survive, and then destroyed once the Night King was defeated.<ref>"[[The Long Night]]"</ref>

Edd's body is later reclaimed and placed into one of the many funeral pyres for those who fell fighting the wights. After Jon finishes his eulogy, Sam lights the pyre where Edd was placed.<ref>"[[The Last of the Starks]]"</ref>
