Gregor continues to raid the villages of the Riverlands from the Lannister army's base at [[Harrenhal]]. His men torture the prisoners they take for information about [[Brotherhood Without Banners|the Brotherhood]] and hidden valuables. He selects the prisoners for torture personally. Ser [[Amory Lorch]] adds a group of captured [[Night's Watch]] recruits to the captives. Lord [[Tywin Lannister]] arrives during the torture and asks Gregor what is going on. Gregor says that they were not expecting Tywin for another day. Tywin asks why the prisoners are not in their cells. Gregor says that their cells are overflowing. [[Polliver|One of Lorch's men]] interjects that the prisoners will not be there long.

Tywin asks if they are so well manned that they can afford to discard able and skilled prisoners. He asks a [[Gendry Baratheon|prisoner]] if he has a trade and learns that he is a smith. Tywin orders the prisoners put to work, sparing the young man.<ref>"[[Garden of Bones (episode)|Garden of Bones]]"</ref>
