Hot Pie and Lommy Greenhands are recruited to join the Night's Watch. They bully "Arry" when she joins their group and demand she give up her sword, Needle. Hot Pie claims that he killed a boy once by kicking him to death. When Arya refuses and threatens to kill him like she has with other "fat boys", he backpedals and bumps into Gendry, who scares him off.
