After arriving at the wall, Meera and Bran are met by the acting Lord Commander of Night's Watch [[Eddison Tollett]]. Meera introduces herself as the daughter of Howland Reed and Bran as well, though Tollett demands some sort of proof that the two of them are indeed who they say they are. Bran delivers an ominous warning regarding the arrival of winter and the white walkers, and Eddison allows them to pass through the wall.<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

When all Bran has to say is "thank you", Meera angrily says that Bran is only alive due to the sacrifices made by her brother, Summer and Hodor.
