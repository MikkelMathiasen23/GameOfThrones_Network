Royce is present at King Snow's meeting regarding plans against the [[White Walkers]]' impending invasion. He opines that [[Last Hearth]] and [[Karhold]] ought to be totally demolished in retribution for [[House Karstark]] and [[House Umber]]'s treason against House Stark.

However, Sansa and Jon disagree with this since the castles themselves nor the children committed the crimes and Jon ultimately allows [[Ned Umber]] and [[Alys Karstark]] to retain their ancestral homes after renewing their pledge of loyalty.<ref name="E61">"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref> Royce speaks out against Jon's plan to treat with [[Daenerys Targaryen]], on the basis that "a Targaryen cannot be trusted" unaware of Jon's own true parentage.<ref name="E62">"[[Stormborn]]"</ref>

Yohn is ordered by Sansa to see that the armor made for their armies are outfitted with leather to keep warm.<ref>"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref> Later, Lord Royce joins Lord [[Robett Glover]] in calling for Regent Sansa to take over from her half-brother Jon Snow as ruler of the North. Sansa rejects their petition and insists that Jon is their true ruler and that she is only a regent. [[Arya Stark]] suggests that Sansa assassinate the troublesome lords but Sansa rejects the idea as repugnant, leading to further anonymity between the sisters.<ref name="E66">"[[Eastwatch]]"</ref>
[[File:705 Yohn Robett and Petyr.png|thumb|Littlefinger speaks clandestinely to Yohn.]]
Arya later witnesses Littlefinger in a clandestine conversation with both Royce and Glover, again contributing to her theory of Sansa's allies consolidating themselves against Jon. However, this is proven to be a result of Baelish's manipulation in what is ostensibly a drumhead trial for Arya Stark. Royce is clearly neither surprised nor displeased that the [[Trial of Petyr Baelish|trial]] turns out to be Littlefinger's instead. Sansa confronts Littlefinger with his countless crimes against the Starks, Arryns, Tullys, and many others who have suffered from the massive war he discreetly started, starting with the murder of Lady Lysa Arryn. 

[[File:707 Petyr and Yohn.png|thumb|Lord Royce rejects Petyr's demand to be escorted back to the Eyrie.]]
When Littlefinger admits to it ostensibly to protect Sansa, Royce glares at him darkly realizing that his suspicions were true. When Petyr invokes his status as Lord Protector of the Vale and demands that Lord Yohn escort him back to the Eyrie, Royce coldly replies, "I think not", signaling that he no longer recognizes his authority. He watches dispassionately, though no doubt with some inner satisfaction, as Lord Baelish is executed by Arya Stark, ending Littlefinger's machinations once and for all.<ref name="E67">"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref>
