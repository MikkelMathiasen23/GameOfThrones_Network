Grey Worm arrives on [[Dragonstone (island)|Dragonstone]], accompanied by Daenerys, Missandei, Tyrion and Varys. He follows Daenerys from the shore of the island to the hall of the castle. He is about to enter the [[Chamber of the Painted Table]], but is stopped by Missandei.<ref>"[[Dragonstone (episode)|Dragonstone]]"</ref>

Grey Worm is present at Daenerys's council with her most important allies when Tyrion Lannister announces that the Unsullied will lead an attack on [[Casterly Rock]] to seize it, that being Daenerys's first move in the [[Daenerys Targaryen's war for Westeros|upcoming war.]]<ref name=":3">"[[Stormborn]]"</ref>

Later, Missandei comes to his chambers to bid him farewell, which indicates that he will lead the attack. There they engage in a conversation in which he tells her that he is the bravest of the Unsullied, yet he still has one weakness - her. He mentions how all the Unsullied faced their weaknesses to beat them, his own weakness being her, leading to a tender kiss. Then Missandei removes her clothes. When she starts to remove his, too, he hesitates before letting her see his castration wounds, after which they start making love by him orally pleasuring her.<ref name=":3">"[[Stormborn]]"</ref>

Grey Worm later leads the Unsullied in [[Fall of Casterly Rock|their attack on Casterly Rock]], using a secret passage built by Tyrion to enter the seemingly impregnable castle. Realizing too late that capturing the Rock was too easy, he is shocked to see [[Euron Greyjoy|Euron Greyjoy's]] fleet obliterating his abandoned ships, leaving the Unsullied without any chance of escape by sea.<ref>"[[The Queen's Justice]]"</ref>

Missandei wonders what has become of Grey Worm, as they have had no word from the Rock, but Daenerys reassures her that they will. Missandei then reveals her sexual relationship with Grey Worm to her queen. Upon exiting the [[dragonglass]] cave, Daenerys is informed of Grey Worm's condition at the Rock. Because of this, she begins to plot the [[Battle of the Goldroad]].<ref>"[[The Spoils of War]]"</ref>

Having led the Unsullied to [[King's Landing]] over land and successfully regrouped with the Dothraki, Grey Worm stands amongst Daenerys's Unsullied army as they and the Dothraki cavalry besiege the city, both to ensure a peaceful parley between Daenerys and [[Cersei Lannister]] and intimidate the Lannister garrison defending the capital. After the parley, he accompanies Daenerys and the rest of her group back to Dragonstone. Grey Worm later sails to [[White Harbour]], as Daenerys and [[Jon Snow]] join all their collective forces to defeat the [[Night King]].<ref>"[[The Dragon and the Wolf]]"</ref>
