The Night King appears again when Jon Snow and Tormund Giantsbane are coordinating the evacuation of Hardhome. Along with a small company of White Walkers, he observes the attack from one of the cliffs above the town as Jon slays one of his lieutenants with Longclaw, a Valyrian steel sword. The Night King looks on this turn of events with mild interest, shocked at his meaningful resistance. As Jon, Tormund and the remaining defenders leave on a boat, the Night King appears on the dock and locks eyes with Jon. With a mere lifting of his arms, the Night King raises the entirety of Hardhome's dead but erstwhile defenders as wights, and keeps his gaze upon Jon as the boat slips away.
