Royce agreed with Petyr Baelish to foster Lord Robin Arryn at Runestone, although he is not impressed with the skills of the young lord, remarking that he "swings a sword like a girl with palsy". Though Littlefinger tells Lord Royce that he and Sansa would be traveling to the Fingers, they instead head west.
