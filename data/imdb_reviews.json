                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Winter is Coming\" starts off 'Game of Thrones' absolutely brilliantly, couldn't change anything for the world. Not many shows have their overall quality, tones, themes and characterisations so spot on and well-established when it first starts, but 'Game of Thrones' is one of the strongest exceptions. It is an example to all first/final episodes of how to start off a show.Visually, \"Winter is Coming\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Winter is Coming\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence and sensitivity.Not only are the more action-oriented/more dramatic moments done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one.\"Winter is Coming\" is so early on and already the characters are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes and have both strengths and flaws and one can understand why they act the way they do.Sean Bean gives some of his best ever acting, as does Kit Harrington. Peter Dinklage has always been one of 'Game of Thrones's' greatest assets and that is totally the case here.All in all, couldn't have started such a wonderful show so perfectly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The hour-long running time offers an intense experience, with plenty of incident and even a few surprises along the way. The photography and performances are excellent and the show has a ring of authenticity to it even at this stage. I also enjoyed the darkness of the opening sequence, which plays like a mini horror film, and the way it naturally flows into an introduction to the Stark clan. The final scene is the perfect hook to get you to watch the next one.",

The opening sequence is breathtaking. The eerie quality of the woods with the men riding through, the bodies lying in the snow with the heads on stakes, are truly frightening. This is a feast for the eyes. As we are pulled into the debauchery of the principles and see the potential conflicts, with the \"monarchy\" calling the shots but vulnerable to forces outside the walls, we see an effort to return a true kingdom by whatever means. The men are mostly Neanderthals and the women have little power. Even those that have a royal being are as bad as the rest as one who would be king is willing to have the entire army have sex with his beautiful sister if it will help regain him the throne. There are amazingly realistic battle scenes, horrifying encounters, and little regard for conventional rules of cinema (like children being killed or worse). Things are wonderfully set up for the next episode.",

Secrets, politic, friendship and loyalty, fragility of power and the danger behind the Wall. Family force and subtle, wise portraits of the basic pieces of the game. It is a fine embroidery of emotions . And one of great first step to a long travel who, after almost a decade, becomes more precious then the end itself.",

One of them survives and deserts the Night Watch and is considered mad and decapitated by Lord Eddard 'Ned' Stark in accordance with their laws. Lord Stark also learns that his friend Jon Arryn, the Hand of the king, is dead and King Robert Baratheon, who is his friend, is traveling from the King's Landing to Winterfall to invite him to be his Hand of the King and travels with him to the capital. The King was betrothed to Lord Stark's sister but she died and he married Cersei Lannister, who has two brothers and a secret love affair. Meanwhile in the exile, the greedy Viserys Targaryen forces his sister Daenerys Targaryen to get married with the brutal warrior Khal Drogo since he needs an army to overthrow King Baratheon and take the power.\"Winter Is Coming\" is the promising beginning of \"Game of Thrones\". The episode has stunning cinematography, very creepy and brutal scenes in the very beginning, betrayals and incestuous relationship. Many characters are introduced at the same time and it is quite confused to keep each name in mind. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Winter is Coming\"",

                    "content": "This opening episode quickly throws us into the action as three members of the Night Watch encounter White Walkers north of The Wall; only one of them survives to tell the tale. We are then introduced to the series many protagonists, starting with the members of House Stark. Led by Lord Ned Stark they govern the north of the Kingdom of Westeros; a harsh land with harsh rules; we see Ned, who is being set up as the hero, decapitate the member of the Night Watch who survived the White Walkers while his sons look on; including Bran Stark who is only ten. The next group to be introduced is King Robert and is in-laws the Lannisters; he is a friend of Ned but the Lannisters seem less pleasant; his wife is having an incestuous affair with her twin brother and her other brother is a dwarf who seems only to be interested in bedding the town's prostitutes! Finally we are introduced to the last of the Targaryens; Viserys and his sister Daenerys, He is determined to retake the throne King Robert took from his father and if that means marrying his sister to the head of a tribe of savages to gain an army he will.This episode does a great job introducing us to many of the large cast of major characters without it feeling like it is just an introduction. The opening scenes show us that this isn't a gentle family friendly fantasy\u0085 and if a decapitation wasn't enough to make it clear this is a show for adults we get nudity, sex, swearing, more violence, incest and more nudity! So if that sort of thing puts you off you'll know to give up now rather than carrying on to watch more! The cast does a great job; I particularly liked Sean Bean's performance as Ned Stark, young Maisie Williams' spirited portrayal of the tomboy Arya Stark, Peter Dinklage's Tyrion 'The Imp' Lannister and Emilia Clarke's Daenerys Targaryen\u0085 although to be honest I could probably go on listing the rest of the cast as no characters seemed weakly portrayed. The production values are such that this looks as good as if not better than most films; the world of Westeros feels real; not at all like a series of sets. This opening episode got me gripped as it sets up multiple story lines; the King asking Ned to return to the capital with him to become his right hand man; the 'Hand of the King', the events north of the wall, the Targaryens' plans to retake the throne and the Lannister twin's actions to hide their relationship; this last storyline leading to a shocking episode conclusion. Watching for the first time this serves as a great introduction but watching again one sees subtle hints of things that will be important later in the series without making it obvious that they will be important. Overall I'd say this was great and if you enjoy this opening you are sure to enjoy the rest of the series.",

                    "content": "The popular TV show taken from the book series by George R.R. Martin began with this initial episode. It very much drops its viewers into a story that's already well under way. In a stark and forbidding land, various families vie for the Iron Throne, and a character named Eddard \"Ned\" Stark (Sean Bean) is asked to serve at the side of the King (Mark Addy). Meanwhile, a cunning young man named Viserys (Harry Lloyd) is very willing to offer up his sister Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) to a warlord, Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa) in exchange for an army, as he plots to take back the throne.'Winter is Coming' mostly serves to set up characters and situations, and while it would probably help to have read the books beforehand, the story here isn't particularly hard to follow. What helps a great deal is the cinematic flair that HBO and the crew of this show gave it; the production values are excellent. Costumes, sets, and location usage are all first-rate. The largely European cast is quite solid, and it's always nice to see Bean in a lead role. Right from the start, Peter Dinklage proved to be a real scene stealer as Tyrion Lannister, the dwarf with the healthy appetites.'Winter is Coming' is mostly low-key, concentrating on atmosphere and world-building rather than action set pieces. It establishes 'Game of Thrones' as a very adult series, complete with nudity and gore. What did surprise this viewer, though, was liberal use of the f-word sprinkled among the mostly antiquated dialogue.Overall, though, the episode kept my attention, and I will be looking forward to continuing with this series.Seven out of 10.",

The performances are pretty good, what is expected for a show like this. I can say that this pilot was better than Boardwalk Empire's for sure. Although that pilot was good, it was heavily flawed, whereas I think this pilot was much more successful and intriguing. I am definitely sticking with this show.",

Based on the first episode, the visuals are almost cinema-quality and we are treated to lavish production design and a rousing score. We are also treated to ripe characterization and on the whole, this looks like it will be a blast. In this episode, \"The Winter Is Coming,\" we meet the Stark clan, the protectors of the North. The North is ruled by Eddard Stark and he has 2 daughters, 3 sons, and a bastard child. The king, King Robert wants Eddard to help protect him after the death of the previous Hand of the King. Meanwhile, across the seas, an exiled Viserys Targaryen marries his sister off to a nomad warlord in exchange for an army in which he can invade Westeros. Finally, trouble arises from the Wall Keepers when an ancient force, long seen as dead, awakens. As for television series go, this series has a very well-known, powerful cast. Peter Dinklage does a good job as Tyrion Lannister. Sean Bean is good as Eddard Stark and likewise Mark Addy as King Robert. Jason Momoa says very little as Khal Drogo, but his presence is menacing. Kit Harington as the bastard child, Jon Snow does a great job. I really like Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark and Richard Madden as Robb Stark. The list goes on and on here.....Lena Headey as Cersei Lannister, Emilia Clarke as Daenarys Targaryen....and so on. Overall, this is a fantastic start to what I hear is an incredible series. If this is the beginning of such epicness, then I am in for a treat. I like how the series does not shy down on its violence as there are some gruesome scenes here. But my oh my, what a start!My Grade: A",

A lot of scenes are very short with us quickly going from one location to another, but there is a lot of ground that needs to be covered. The wonderful title sequence is a joy. Those who are fans of the books will find that much in this first episode follows the book quite closely, though there are some changes here and there. The introduction of the Starks is a very nicely done and the introduction of the Targaryen siblings is excellent. The scene with Tyrion Lannister and Jon Snow was my favourite scene of the episode. And, of course, the ending had me wanting to watch the next episode straight away! Prior to the last scene I thought, it had been OK and I would persevere with it, but the ending made me need I each it straight away.",

                    "content": "Right from the start Game of Thrones is beautifully well made. As a viewer you would not necessarily know what is going on unless you had read the books but the quality of production is clear straight away. The filming is of very high standard, the sets, costumes, music etc are all spot on. Most of all it is the dialogue, acting and the plot which sets this show way above the normal standard of TV shows. The first episode begins with the quality already all there to see in all these respects.One negative of this first episode is that there perhaps could have been some clearer and more logical depiction of the passage of time. Dialogue explains a month has passed but this passage of time is unclear in its presentation. Some things seem to have needed a different passage of time. The direwolves found as tiny pups at the start remain very small right to the last scene before appearing as much larger animals at the start of episode 2 which is meant to be only a few weeks later. This is actually a 'fault' of the book 'A Game of Thrones', the first of author GRR Martin's great 'A Song of Ice and Fire' book series. The first book is very faithfully adapted in season 1 (apart from older ages for characters in the series than in the books) and I feel the passage of time could have actually been improved. Martin's book depicts each chapter from a different character's point of view. This is brilliant dramatically and artistically but it does not lend itself to neat chronological progress as things seem to progress at slightly different rates for different characters or at least the passage of weeks and months is not fully clear. For the series it would be better in my view if they showed the initial events of the prologue and the direwolf pups being found as happening around the same time before showing that many months have passed before Jon Arryn's death and initial events at Winterfell with the royal visit then shown to happen later having had time to travel up from King's Landing. That way the pups could have grown already in order that they can believably be normal wolf size (though not full grown direwolf yet) for episode 2 and it would have given a better feeling of time progressing from Jon Arryn's death to the royal visit.The only other issue is this episode understandably has to introduce a lot of characters, settings and set up the storyline so it is quite heavily laden to take in and fully enjoy when you first see it, unless you have read the first book. It is much more enjoyable re-watching it when you know how it all pans out.Those aspects means it is not one of the series best episodes but it is excellent in establishing the series roots. The settings and characters are presented very effectively and the story is quite absorbing by halfway through the episode.It is difficult to pick out any particular actor. The ensemble cast all deliver top performances. Sean Bean immediately makes Ned Stark a fully three dimensional character you are sympathising with and Kit Harrington as Jon Snow gets you on his side from the beginning too. Cersei and Viserys immediately make your skin crawl while Mark Addy and Peter Dinklage make you laugh as King Robert and Tyrion. I feel Tyrion is slightly less sympathetically presented in this episode than he is in the book but he goes on in later episodes to be presented more favourably.The differing ages of characters from the books to the series is quite a big difference. In the books Jon and Robb are 14, Dany is 13, Joffrey is 12, Sansa is 11, Bran is only 7 and Rickon is 3 whilst Ned, Robert, Cat, Cersei, Jaime and Tyrion are all only meant to be mid thirties at most! It is a 'double edged sword' because in some ways I think it would have been nice and made sense for the ages and timescales to be the same as in the book but it was much easier to present some of the events with older actors as the Stark children and they make it all work really well. I am happy we got the cast we did.The cliffhanger at the end of the episode is done to perfection and is the hook that grabs you. From that point I was on board 100% and could not wait for the second episode.8.5/10",

So if you tuned in to this show and have started watching I have news for you, it just gets better and better. Also some advice, don't get attached to a character because in the Game of Thrones you win or you die.",

                    "content": "Grade: B+I've taken it upon myself to rewatch Game of Thrones from the very start, recording my thoughts on each and every episode as I go along. I still maintain that this is a great series, despite the last two seasons weren't up to the quality of the others (and in all honesty, seasons 5 and 6 weren't quite as great as seasons 1-4, though there were certainly great episodes contained within). And while I can understand the backlash to some extent, I don't think the lesser episodes ruin the quality of the earlier ones. Watching the show as it was coming out, starting back in 2011, the almost year-long waits between seasons was frustrating, as I was so invested, and so excited to see the story progress. Being able to rewatch the show now, not remembering everything but also more or less knowing what is coming, I hope will provide for a rewarding experience.This is a very good pilot. It is far from perfect, however, and it certainly doesn't rank among the best episodes of Game of Thrones. It throws a lot at the viewer and expects them to follow along. While it is easy to follow once you've watched the series (and some clunky exposition now feels very forced), watching it for the first time comes close to feeling overwhelming... but not in an awful way. It's a big world, there are many locations, and countless important characters, so the pilot naturally needs to prepare you for this.As for those characters: most of the introductions here are very solid. Going back, it's amazing how young some of the cast looks, and impressive that a good deal of characters already feel like genuine people living in a believable world. The way the story starts with so much history having already happened helps too- many conversations this season, starting in this episode, do revolve around character reflecting on their past and the history of Westeros as a whole, while blissfully unaware of the horrors in many of their futures.That's something this pilot establishes quite well too: the danger and brutality of the world. The first ten minutes feature a group of characters who do not survive beyond the first third of the episode. This is something of a warning sign: the world of Westeros is brutal, and people will die in alarmingly violent, often quite sudden ways. While you don't know the extent of that violence yet, as a first time viewer, I think the series' opening scene serves well to establish Game of Thrones' most infamous trope.Winter is Coming is a fine introduction to Westeros, and numerous satisfying character introductions make for a very good pilot, as well as a fun episode to revisit. And the cliffhanger with Bran being pushed out the window will almost certainly hook you into watching the next episode...",

                    "content": "Oh my! What an incredible beginning to what will become my favorite television series to date. Based on the insanely popular Song of Ice and Fire fantasy series by George Martin, David Benioff and D.B Weiss undertook a massive mission to bring this series to the small screen. It could have been an epic failure, but instead this was a big win for HBO and all the audiences worldwide. This series has so much to dissect, so much meaning it brings to the screen. Every episode in this series tells an individual story while focusing on a main arc and that is ripe for quality characterization.One thing I noticed right away is the look of the series. I never watched the series in HD, but I can still see how immense the production value is. The producers really care for their new baby and that includes giving the series the best look possible. I loved the cinematic presentation with the lavish production design, fantastic costumes, and a rousing orchestral score by composer Ramin Djwadi. The opening title sequence is a thing of beauty that illustrates the setting and characters of the season and it's a really genius idea, honestly.This episode is designed to introduce us to the main characters we will come to associate with over the course of the series. Eddard 'Ned\" Stark (Sean Bean) rules the northern part of the kingdom called Westeros. He lives in Winterfell with his wife, Cat (Michelle Fairley) and his five children; the eldest son Robb (Richard Madden), the princess-in-training Sansa (Sophie Turner), the tomboyish Arya (Maisie Williams), the peeping Bran (Isaac Hempstead-Wright), and the young Rickon. Ned's illegitimate child, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) lives with the family and he is about to fulfill his vows with the Night Watch, an organization bent on keeping the peace of Westeros by guarding the wall that borders the northern part of the kingdom with the icelands of the North. Everyone's life will change after two events. The first event is when a deserter from the Night Watch claims the White Walkers (which are zombies, more or less) returned. The second event is when King Robert Baratheon (Mark Addy) pays a visit to Ned at Winterfell. King Robert brings his wife Cersei Lannister (Lena Headey), his son Joffrey (Jack Gleeson), and the two Lannister siblings; the warrior Jaime (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) and the small, sarcastic Tyrion (Peter Dinklage). Robert wants Ned to go to the kingdom's capital-King's Landing where he will be Robert's new Hand (or chief advisor) and investigate the death of his prior Hand, Jon Arryn. Meanwhile, we are introduced to more characters across the Narrow Sea. Viserys Targaryen (Harry Lloyd) is a descendant of the Mad King whom King Robert overthrew. Viserys wants to take the kingdom back for himself, but he needs to make an alliance with the Dothraki horde-a group of nomad warrior people led by Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa). In order to form this alliance, he wants to use his sister Danys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) as a bargaining chip.Wow, that was a lot of plot to sum up! It's funny because this plot summary only describes the first 15-20 minutes of this dense episode. While the action scenes are mighty impressive, this show makes use of fantastic monologue. I found surprising at first how talkative the show is. Fortunately, the dialogue is interesting and the actors generally carry them well. It allows these actors to chew some scenery.Speaking of actors, the show has a zillion brand names that delivered very strong, effective performances. The big veterans are Bean, Dinklage, and Addy. All bring depth to their roles. I really liked Dinklage's performance. His sarcasm is through-the-roof hilarious. Addy delivers his dialogue like no one else does. Maisie Williams is a real find as Arya Stark. Child actors are hit-or-miss for me, but sometimes I don't even see her as a child actress with this role. There were more characters that are important that I wasn't able to describe here such as Iain Glen as Jorah Mormont, a veteran soldier allied with the Targaryens, and Alfie Allen as Theon Greyjoy, a steward for the Starks.Overall, \"A Winter Is Coming\" is a very good introductory episode to the immensely popular Game of Thrones. Within fifteen minutes, there are two beheadings. That tells you right off the bat what is in store for you. The ending is a dandy of a cliffhanger. It really shows how despicable the Lannisters are and it gets worst (or better from a viewer's standpoint) from there. This show possesses cinematic quality due to its lavish production design, great makeup/costumes, the broad scope of the show, the fantastic acting from the all-star cast. I had some issues with the plot regarding Viserys. His character often annoyed me and made my unsympathetic to his cause, although Emilia Clarke does an amazing job. Favorite scenes of mine include: the Stark clan rescuing the direwolves, Ned making Bran watch a beheading, anything with Peter Dinklage, and the interaction between Jon Snow and King Robert. It gets better from here, so be ready!My Grade: A-",

                    "content": "Before I begin this review, I like to point out that I only watched the entire fifth season. The reason why I couldn't watch the first four is because I was at high school at the time until I decided to watch them online and it started with the first season. So now that I've caught up and anticipating for the sixth season, I will review all of the Game of Thrones episode starting with this time.The episode takes place in Winterfell where the warriors of the Night Watch search for savages until they're attacked by white walkers. One of them survives and gets decapitated by Lord Ned Stark (Sean Bean). After he kills him, he learns that that his friend Jon Arryn, the Hand of the king, is dead and King Robert Baratheon, who is his friend, is traveling from the King's Landing to Winterfall to invite him to be his Hand of the King and travels with him to the capital. The King was betrothed to Lord Stark's sister but she died and he married Cersei Lannister, who has two brothers and a secret love affair. Meanwhile in the exile, the greedy Viserys Targaryen forces his sister Daenerys Targaryen to get married with the brutal warrior Khal Drogo since he needs an army to overthrow King Baratheon and take the power.Winter is Coming is not only superb, but it's also a very solid start to a very successful show. My only quibble is that it does drag a bit longer, but that's just nitpicking. Everything else is done really well.Now, I haven't read the entire book series (save for two), but those who read them however will be pleased by how it stays faithful to the source material (aside from some changes here and there). Even the opening title sequence is awesome. Gorgeous visuals and beautiful music from Ramin Djawadi which are the two reasons why the theme song would later be memorable to those who watch the show. The story is well-written it does take time to develop the characters and it has some very atmospheric moments particularly the beginning.And needless to say, it's very well-acted and there are some great performances. Sean Bean (known for playing Boromir in \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring\") gives a superb performance as a calm and wise lord of the Stark family. There's also Peter Dinklage and he also gives a superb performance as a dwarf at the House of Lannister named Tyrion Lannister and brings some humor to the character. The rest of the cast does very well and they give some great interactions in the entire episode. Even the child actors did a very good job. Then, there's the scenery where it looks really gorgeous from the landscapes to the castles and such. It looks appealing when it comes to TV shows.Overall, Winter Is Coming is a great start to the show and I'll do what I can to review all of the episodes before the 6th Season comes out.",

Should we know the relationship between the king and Ned Stark, where they've been through, or what they did together? No we shouldn't! The show should introduce that to us! But instead they show sex, nudity, and stupid boring scenes of a woman staring at the ocean, and other dude unclothing her.I really don't know the books, haven't read them or so, but if I should guess, it would introduce the characters way better than this stupid pilot episode.It'll be a 1 and that's for the effort of accurately recreating the medieval period, cause the rest is garbage well sold and advertised. No nice characters, no heart or any interesting or intelligent plot just pure boredom!",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Kingsroad\" is only the second episode and, while the pilot \"Winter is Coming\" is marginally superior, the quality is just as brilliant as before. Not many shows have their overall quality, tones, themes and characterisations so spot on and well-established when it first starts, but 'Game of Thrones' is one of the strongest exceptions. Really appreciated the more reflective tone here, and actually didn't mind at all that the story was not quite as eventful and slower in pace because the characterisation and overall quality is just so well done.Visually, \"The Kingsroad\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Kingsroad\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced so beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence and sensitivity. The ending is a genuine shocker, and in a good way.Not only are the more action-oriented/more dramatic moments done with a lot epic scale, superb staging, excitement and dramatic tension but underneath all the scale and flashy attention to detail there is a lot of heart and a multi-layered one.\"The Kingsroad\" is so early on and already the characters are so well developed and as close to real life as one can get despite being in a fantasy world. These characters are not hero and villain archetypes (excepting Joffrey and he is an extremely interesting villain) and have both strengths and flaws and one can understand why they act the way they do.Sean Bean and Kit Harrington both give some of their best ever work consistently in 'Game of Thrones', that can be seen here. Maisie Williams and Emilia Clarke are affecting, Lena Headey is deliciously manipulative and Peter Dinklage continues to be one of 'Game of Thrones' biggest pleasures. Can't not mention Jack Gleeson, whose Joffrey so early on is one of television's nastiest pieces of work, which Gleeson relishes to perfection, and he's not even at his most evil yet.In conclusion, brilliant if not quite as good. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Joffrey in particular emerges as the show's most sadistic villain, a gloriously evil youth whose actions end up spelling disaster for most of the assembled characters; it all starts out so trivially, too. Ser Jorah and the Hound, my two favourite characters, get a chance to show off their personalities, and already there are bloody shocks and character building at play.",

When the action moves back to Winterfell we learn that young Bran survived his fall but lies in a coma; his mother ever at his side. Ned Stark heads south to King's Landing with his daughters Sansa and Arya, and the King and his entourage while his illegitimate son Jon Snow heads north to The Wall to join the Night Watch. On the road south Sansa becomes close to the King's son, Prince Joffrey, he shows his true colours when he and Sansa come across Arya and her friend the butcher's boy sword fighting with sticks; he draws his real sword and cuts the boy then threatens Arya when she defends him; luckily her direwolf protects her; having been bested by a girl Joffrey lies giving us hints of what is to come with his characters.There may be less happening in this episode than the first but it is never boring as we delve deeper into the various characters. We see that Daenerys isn't the weak character she initially appeared to be; Emilia Clarke does a fine job capturing her determination. Back in King's Landing we learn more about several characters; most notably Prince Joffrey; Jack Gleeson does a great job playing this vile character; nicely capturing how he is both a bully and a sniveling coward. Maisie Williams continues to impress as the spirited Arya Stark; it was great seeing her stand up to Joffrey. Two episodes in and I'm totally gripped by the multiple intertwined story lines with a large cast of interesting and believable characters.",

It turns out that Bran has survived his fall, and the despicable Lannisters must take steps to make sure he can't tell the truth about it. Jon Snow sees \"The Wall\" for the first time. Daenerys receives lessons from a slave in how to pleasure a man. And an ugly confrontation among the children (the \"dire wolf\" Nymeria comes to the rescue) results in friction between the Starks and the King & his family.This series remains intriguing to watch, in part because of the antiquated setting, and the dialogue & its delivery. There is some violence, but not that much gore. A sense of humour arises in the scene where Daenerys is repulsed by the taste of horse flesh. (The Dothraki only have two things in abundance: horse and grass, and humans can't live on grass.) There's lots of good character moments, and some wonderful acting (Jack Gleeson is effectively odious as a snot-nosed prince, Michelle Fairley a delight as the devoted mother / wife Catelyn Stark), not to mention efficient direction by former actor Timothy Van Patten, who also guided the pilot episode. (You may remember him as the head villain in the 1980s cult flick \"Class of 1984\".) The presence of the dragon eggs is a fun touch, leaving this viewer to anticipate the appearance of the fabled beasts at some point in the series.One word of warning, though: wolf lovers may find this a tough watch.Eight out of 10.",

That being said, it's a quieter, more reflective episode, but that doesn't stop the show from being excellent. The ending is fantastic and kind of sad. In this episode, \"The Kingsroad,\" Ned Stark takes his daughters with him to Kings Landing where it's agreed that Sansa will marry Prince Joffey. Trouble arises when Arya's pet wolf attacks Joffey. Meanwhile, Bran is unconscious from his fall and little hope remains about his recovery. Jon Snow travels with his uncle to the Wall. Finally, Daenerys is having trouble pleasing her new husband, the warlord Khal Drogo. Overall, this is an excellent episode. The technical side of the series remain a high point. I really enjoyed the story throughout. It started slow, but picked up steam towards the end. The ending was quite a shocker. But after the first two episodes, consider me hooked. My Grade: A",

And whilst it was not as enjoyable as the first episode, it's still a good episode.On the whole, it's a pretty depressing episode, with most of the characters being very unhappy. There are a few scenes that I particularly liked, The first one featuring Jon Snow and Arya Stark. This episode is the first to really give Maisie Williams as Arya really decent scenes, and she does wonderfully, she is very cute and endearing in the scene with Jon, and then later she is brave and feisty during her confrontation with Prince Joffery. One with Tyrion and Jon en route to The Wall, and again one featuring Jon. This time with Caitelyn by Brandon's bedside. I do need to praise Michelle Fairley, because her acting in these scenes is very good. As he is pivotal to three of my favourite scenes I need to add Kit Harrington is doing an awesome job as the bastard Jon Snow. As is Peter Dinklage, he simply steals every scene that he is in.This is the first time, I have found myself liking a character played by Sean Bean. He is not someone whose work I have ever enjoyed, but his vulnerability as a noble Ned Stark who's prepared to do what he must (albeit with a heavy heart) is one I am particularly taken with. Jack Gleason deserves special praise too, as he simply makes you despise Prince Joffery. And the final moment? Once again I needed to watch the next episode straight away",

                    "content": "The second episode of Game of Thrones builds nicely on the excellent opening. Looking at it now it is moving to see characters saying farewells as they go on journeys from which we know some will not return for a long time, if ever. We see the Starks starting to split up to follow different paths with Jon Snow riding off to 'take the black' and Ned riding to King's Landing.Acting is brilliant across the whole cast and the very well written dialogue is intelligently supporting the intriguing plot. At this point the show is not quite up to top speed but is establishing itself with incredibly high standards.One grumble I have with the transition from episode 1 to this episode is that when Bran's direwolf Summer is shown, the animal is strikingly large when at the end of episode 1 it was still a very small pup. It is established that only a few weeks has passed between these two points so even for a fast growing direwolf in a fantasy setting it seems jarringly improbable that it could have grown so much in such a short time. An avoidable lapse in internal logic perhaps but not a major one and really that fault lies with the first episode not this episode. Within this episode there is no issue.On the plus side the plot moves on well increasing the level of interest for a new viewer. This episode also starts to establish Daenerys' character (Emilia Clarke) strongly with her showing some strength and drive. The star of this episode is probably Jack Gleeson's Joffrey though. His brilliantly slimy, cocky and nasty little turd of a Prince is wonderfully brought to the fore in a scene where Arya's direwolf bites him. This also leads to some moving scenes as well as letting Maisie Williams as Arya show that she too is a real little star. Mark Addy and Sean Bean play the father figures with aplomb and Lena Headey as Cersei is already a manipulative bitch Queen.9/10",

Most viewers will tell you that there are few other characters in the show- maybe in all of fiction- that come close to being as unlikable as Joffrey. By the episode's end, he is responsible for the unjustified murder of both a young boy who didn't deserve to die, and an adorable, completely innocent direwolf, and as hard as it is to believe he can get any worse, naturally, he does. Also established: cute animals and children are not safe from death, in the world of Game of Thrones...Joffrey had a certain unpleasant aura in the show's first episode, despite having no lines of dialogue, thanks to Jack Gleeson's excellent acting: his sneer and his body language were enough to make you feel a bit uncomfortable right from the start. But here, he's given the opportunity to speak and enact his violent tendencies, and it really is a great introduction for one of the show's most memorable villains. Sansa's direwolf proves to be another casualty- one of the first of many- within the show, and it speaks volumes about Ned's character that he agrees to put it down, though not without comforting it first. Sansa's devotion to Joffrey is hard to buy at points, especially because she will forgive him for her pet's death- I suppose the character is very young and na\u00efve. I buy Sophie Turner's naivety, but I think she looks a little older than the character is supposed to be (it might have something to do with her height?), which gives me this gut feeling that to some extent, she should know better than to fawn over Joffrey.More believable- though still frustrating and hard to watch- is Catelyn Stark's attitude towards Jon Snow. It's the first of many character interactions where you can understand both sides while not wanting them to have that conflict, and then have to sit with that as a viewer. I can't hate Catelyn for disliking Jon Snow- he is a constant reminder of a time in which Ned was not faithful to her. And I feel sorry for Jon, of course- he's already established to be a friendly and faithful member of the Stark family, who gets on well with his half-siblings and father.The Stark and Lannister rivalry really begins in this episode too, with the climactic confrontation regarding Joffrey being bitten signifying the first time the houses clash quite violently. There was some tension previously, especially when Jaime and Ned have an uncomfortable exchange at the feast in episode 1, but things get considerably tenser by this episode's end.For introducing a great villain, establishing one of the show's core conflicts, and beginning to move the characters to locations where important events will play out, The Kingsroad works as a very satisfying episode of Game of Thrones that continues to build things up. And once again, we have a cliffhanger surrounding Bran- he's woken up, and seems to sense Lady's death, despite it happening miles and miles away...",

We learn more about the relationship between Ned Stark and his wife, Cat and their history together. We learn just how manipulative and evil the Lannisters can be. The back half of this episode will drive that point home. One of my chief complaints about the first episode was that Daenarys Targaryen was not developed enough. The show does start to develop her character here and her dragon eggs that were given to her as a wedding gift is going to be of some significance. The atmosphere of this episode is tense, and that might be too kind of a word. The characters are brooding and in general, a sad bunch. Considering the events of the first episode, you can hardly blame them. This is an episode that is heavy-handed on character development, but it is a necessity. I was very eager to learn more about these characters.\"A Winter is Coming\" ended with the tragic fall of Bran Stark after witnessing unpleasantry between the Jaime and Cersei Lannister. Bran now lies unconscious in his Winterfell home. Catelyn stays at his bedside day and night despite little hope for his recovery. Despite his son's injury, duty calls for Ned as he must leave Winterfell to travel to King's Landing with King Robert. The king and Ned agree that Sansa and the repulsive Joffrey must marry, which would unite their families. Ned brought his daughters with him and trouble happens with Arya is playing with a butcher's boy. Joffrey challenges the boy and that ends with the prince attacked by Arya's direwolf. King Robert passes fair punishment, although Cersei does not agree with his judgement. Meanwhile, Jon Snow travels to the Wall with his Uncle Benjen and Tyrion Lannister. Finally, we head across to the Narrow Sea where Daenarys is having trouble adjusting to married life. She recruits the help of a slave to learn how she could please her husband.This episode is great to watch and is also emotional at times. The scene with Arya's direwolf attacking Joffrey and the aftermath is hard to watch. This scene also shows how villainous Cersei can be. After the attack, Arya runs to the woods with her wolf and sets him free. In retaliation, Cersei demands that Sansa's direwolf to be punished instead. That was an emotional scene. Sansa's personality enables all of this to happen, but wow Cersei is quite the b...h. In defense of his daughters, Ned gives a rousing speech about how the direwolves are a symbol of the North but to no avail. And it is up to Ned to perform this nasty deed and as he does so, he realizes how his daughter was involved in a death of an innocent. Of course, we all blame Joffrey too.Overall, this episode is fantastic and full of character developments. We learn more about the history whether it's from Ned and Robert talking about why they waged war against the Mad King Targaryen or Tyrion describing how the Lannisters came into power. The acting is fantastic! Peter Dinklage delivers his dialogue in such an amazing way. Jack Gleeson, Lena Headey, Kit Harington, and Maisie Williams are all standouts in this episode. Plus, the episode ends with another cliffhanger regarding Bran. After these two great episodes, consider me hooked!My Grade: A-",

Arya is playing with the butcher's boy nearby the river and Joffrey and Sansa meet them and Joffrey picks fight with the boy that does not react. Arya throws Joffrey's sword in the river and he attacks the girl but her wolf protects Arya. Daenerys has difficulties to sexually satisfy Khal Drogo and her slave teaches her how to please her man. Jon Snow travels with his uncle Benjen to The Wall to join the Night Watch. Catelyn investigates the location where Brans felt and she finds a hair. Meanwhile Bran awakes from his coma.The Kingsroad does a good job continuing where the first episode left off. The character relationships are still excellent, the acting is still superb, the scenery is still gorgeous, the script is well-written, and the music score from Ramin Djawadi continues to be beautiful in every word. My only quibble is that it did drag, but the pacing is a bit more tighter this time around. So, overall, good episode.",

                    "content": "Dead or alive ? The question shameful viewers like me, because we haven't read the novel yet, had in their mind for a week after the pilot tragic events. It was answered right after the fantastic title sequence that smooths the immersion process dramatically. At the start your mind is still thinking about your day but once the episode begins it has entered a medieval realm one can only be reluctant to leave.Indeed all parallel stories have potential and despite their slow pace even an impatient wouldn't leave its seat for a second. Indeed on the Stark and Lannister side the boy's accident has unveiled the true nature of some characters like Cersei (Lena Headey), a Queen gnawed by anger, and Jaime (Nikolaj Coaster-Walday), the white knight a damsel in distress would regret to be rescued by. To tell the truth in Winter is Coming I had no idea they were related because I just couldn't keep up with all the names and locations. But when watching becomes nearly as demanding as reading then you know the adaptation was respectful of its source material. Still even if all these webby connections between players, because chess is a great metaphora of life, are exciting I hope their profiles are not as Manichaean as they seem. Hopefully we should know why some love while others hate. Otherwise I have no doubt about Arya Stark, the little girl vigorously played by Maisie Williams, and her mother Catelyn. Michelle Fairley revealed a palette of extreme emotions that forged her scenes like blades of steel. As for her daughter you really have to see her play with the gift one of her brothers offered her. If it had been Chucky it would have either fall in love with her or worry about its life because when Arya is angry, well she seems as dangerous as an innocent clown piranha about to have its midnight breakfast.Juggling is both an entertaining and interesting medieval craft but now the mysterious and worried Daenerys Targaryen has convinced me to throw dragon eggs in the mix. Emilia Clarke gave a seductive performance and I like the way her whiteness contrasts with her tribal husband. Harry Lloyd's appearances as her wicked brother Viserys are rare but percussive. Will he get his crown back ? Will she free herself from him ? In fact does she even want to ? There's almost something mystical about their story and I wonder if she has other resources to survive than her exquisite shapes. But between two shy glimpses at her royal hips I also strongly recommend the audience to pay attention to the dialogs because this time they were heavy on mythology. Where do the dragons come from ? What do the fields represent for the Dothraki people ? Similar questions could also be raised considering the Stark side as some friendly battle between the bastard and the dwarf occurred in the woods. It should even make you question what happened at the very beginning of the pilot even if I have no doubt about it\u0085Other gems include the Dothraki language, specially developed for the show \u2013 very Tolkienian, an almost sapphic kamasutra lesson \u2013 can't wait the next, and an ongoing investigation about the boy's fall. But this short list, compared to the installment diversity and greatness, would be even more incomplete if one word wasn't added : Wolf. Indeed the story was wild every which way. What a thrilling way to use these majestuous and savage hunters ! They actually reminded me of White Fang (Jack London) and I wonder how they see things from their point of view. Wouldn't it be dazzling to actually film a scene from there ? So let's hope the other directors and minds behind the show will surprise us with their creativity. All in all it was an other awards magnet and if the end doesn't electrify you well I don't know what will !",

                    "content": "In the opener for this show, we had some major things happening in the plot, and now we see how the characters live with that. Just as in the George R. R. Martin novels, we see the story told from different points of view and just as in the opening episode, we learn that this show is more focused on introducing us to all the different characters rather than showing us immense fights or special effects like The Lord of the Rings movies. This is something that I highly appreciate and that I loved in \"Winter Is Coming\", but this episode was still a fairly big disappointment to me. I'll tell you why:The first episode of GoT was perfect in every imaginable way. The visuals were immensely stunning, the screenplay was a hundred per cent Emmy-worthy and the actors were really talented. This doesn't also disappear with this episode, but it's a huge surprise that David Benioff and D. B. Weiss weren't able to recreate the unique and fantastic vibe that the screenplay of \"Winter is Coming\" had with this follow-up. Some scenes are unnecessary (never a good sign for shows like this), they included annoying and idiotic soliloquies at times, and they dialogs aren't so good as they were in the former episode. I wasn't bored at all by this episode because I was already so into all the characters (I watched the opening episode 3 times on 3 days), but it focused too much on stupid stuff. All the stuff with Arya, Sansa, the butcher's boy and this gay prince whose name I always forget was complete nonsense and I can't see how this is necessary to the plot. The show seemed like a soap opera to me at that point. Some other plot parts were really good though, a great example is the one with Daenerys (put more Viserys in the next episode, he is a great character!) who's currently trying to make the best out of her lousy situation.Concluding, I enjoyed this episode a lot despite some things that bugged me. It's clearly inferior to \"Winter is Coming\", but it still has a magnificent visual look (gotta add that: the Blu-Ray quality is just one of the best I've ever seen!) and the actors really make the best out of it! The outstanding cast member in this episode was Lena Headey who was a fantastic minor villain.",

Cat, being a woman, seems to not understand what honor means, but Ned perfectly does. He has to be with his king and he leaves Winterfell to serve his king as a prime minister.Another thing Ned goes through to proves his so-called honor is when defending his youngest daughter Arya, after she caused the king's son to be beaten by her pet-beast, a direwolf. I won't say what the end of this is in order to not say spoilers for the readers, but it's a big issue for Ned. Now he's between his own family or the loyalty to his king.Finally, in the other side of the sea, a professional prostitute, who is Daenerys' servant as well, teaches her how to be a perfect slut for the dothraki chief.

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Lord Snow\" may not be quite as good as the brilliant first two episodes, but it still manages to be extremely good. Which does say a lot about the overall quality of 'Game of Thrones' as a show. The dialogue occasionally rambles and \"Lord Snow\" slightly suffers from trying to introduce new characters and concepts in a short space of time. Putting small emphasis on slightly because the characterisation is still superb and the ideas explored well, there was just the occasional sense of there being a little too many.Not many shows have their overall quality, tones, themes and characterisations so spot on and well-established when it first starts, but 'Game of Thrones' is one of the strongest exceptions. The slower, more reflective and loose feel to the storytelling was appreciated and actually was appropriate considering the character and story density.Visually, \"Lord Snow\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Lord Snow\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again, even with the odd rambling part here and there. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced mostly very beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity. That it is heavy exposition managed to just about work.Standout moments are the ending, Robert and the Kingsguard and Small Council scenes, while the father and daughter relationship and chemistry couldn't have been better depicted.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, Sean Bean and Kit Harrington both give some of their best ever work consistently in 'Game of Thrones', that can be seen here. Maisie Williams is really coming into her own and Peter Dinklage continues to be a high-point. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau sinks his teeth into the character of Jaime and Syrio's role may be small but not one to forget. It is hard to pick standouts though because everybody here pulls out all the stops and nobody is bad.Overall, not quite as good as the previous two episodes but still excellent. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

It isn't long before Catelyn Stark is also in the capital; she is trying to find out who provided the dagger that was to be used to kill Bran and soon the finger is pointing at Tyrion Lannister. Meanwhile Tyrion is at The Wall with Jon Snow; here we learn more about the Night Watch; they aren't the great army of legend, rather they are undermanned and unprepared for the long winter that is to come. Elsewhere we learn that Bran has no memory of how he came to fall from the wall and over the sea Daenerys learns that she is pregnant and Viserys learns that the Dothraki will side with his sister over him.While this episode lacked real action it more than made up for it with intrigue and the introduction to soon interesting new characters. Aidan Gillen is suitably slippery as Baelish a character who manages to be friendly yet potentially dangerous, Conleth Hill is also great as Lord Varys; a mercurial character who seems to know everything he needs to survive in the dangerous city of King's Landing. The final introduction of the episode was Arya's 'dance' instructor Syrio Forel; he was only in it for a few minutes but I have a feeling he will be a great character; Miltos Yerolemou was great in the role. Here we also see Arya developing nicely as a character; Maisie Williams has a couple of great scenes; first with Sean Bean, playing her father, then when Syrio starts teaching her how to use a sword.Other highlights of the episode included an interesting conversation between Queen Cersei and her son Joffrey; Lena Headey and Jack Gleeson are great in these roles\u0085 clearly the two characters are as bad as each other. The scene where Viserys makes the mistake of confronting his sister was rewarding as it showed that power is slipping from this vile character and his sister now has it; again Harry Lloyd and Emilia Clarke are great.Overall another fine episode that shows you don't need lots of action in every episode to keep the audience gripped.",

Poor Bran learns that he has been crippled for life after his fall. Daenerys starts to acclimate well to the life of a queen, also learning that she has become pregnant (with a boy, she believes). Jon Snow, Ned's illegitimate son, undertakes the training necessary to become a member of the Night's Watch.As usual, this viewer is impressed with the level of care and precision that the cast and crew of this series show off. 'Game of Thrones' was given a true cinematic flair, indeed, with some incredible sets and locations alike, and the cast absolutely shines in their colourful roles. They grace us with some truly excellent performances, totally immersing us in this antiquated, classic fantasy world. Sean Bean in particular has always been one of this viewers' favourite actors, and it's nice to see him as the lead protagonist in a series when he'd made his name playing various villains. (Leading to that amusing running joke of how often he's been killed off in movies.) It was also a treat to see such veterans as Julian Glover (\"The Empire Strikes Back\", \"For Your Eyes Only\") and Peter Vaughan (\"Straw Dogs\", \"Brazil\") in guest starring roles.The dialogue is still an invigorating mix of antiquated speech & delivery, and pointed use of cuss words. Best of all, 'Lord Snow' successfully walks a line between very serious and heartfelt moments and some priceless humour (like Tyrion urinating off the top of The Wall at one point).The series continues to be fun to watch.Seven out of 10.",

There is nothing much in the way of action, but it does deliver on terms of political intrigue and rapid characterization. Everyone's character is developed even more in this episode. So far, my favorite scenes are the ones involving Ned Stark as the chief adviser to the king and Jon Snow in his training up north. In this episode, \"Lord Snow,\" Ned Stark and his daughters arrive in King's Landing and Ned is put to work right away. His wife comes to visit him to tell him about Bran's attempted murder. Jon Snow trains up north to much scorn but he may have found a Lannister friend. Meanwhile across the seas, Daenerys refuse to take orders from her brother. Overall, this is a rather great episode. It's light on the episode, but the political side of the show is prevalent and interesting. I also liked how Arya is training with the sword, despite going against the rules of society. My Grade: A",

We are introduced to Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen), aka \"Littlefinger,\" and Coneth Hill is perfect as Varys, the King's Master of Whisperers. The scenes at the Wall give us plenty of Tyrion, (which in my opinion is a good thing) There are a lot of fine moments in this episode, in particular a couple of scenes with Arya. The high point is the final scene which features Arya as she studies swordsmanship. Jaime's more fleshed out here. One of my favourite scenes was where Eddard enters the throne room (the first time we see both the throne room and the Iron Throne). It's another great tension filled scene between the two and I enjoyed it. Another great scene is the farewell between Jon and Tyrion. The scenes between the two of them have been some of my favourites so far, as I'm a bit sad that there may not be any more. But a key scene for this episode is between Ned and Arya, and how they spend their time together. Maisie Williams is showcased, and is predictably fantastic, it's a well done scene and Maisie seems capable of great chemistry with Sean Bean and, indeed, everyone else she acts with so far.Maisie Williams simply steals this episode for me. She had some good scenes including a rather hilarious line. Her scene with Ned (Sean Bean) was a touching one, and her scene with dancing master Syrio Forell is one of my favourites of the season so far. As for the rest of the cast Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau proves to be a fine pantomime villain as Jaime Lannister and Harry Lloyd is terrific as Viserys.",

Martin's books continues the strong start following two very good opening episodes.Ned Stark arrives in King's Landing taking up his duties as Hand to the King. He meets the two political geniuses Varys and 'Littlefinger' Baelish both of whom make immediate impact with finely acted scenes of dialogue. Sansa and Arya are with Ned and Catelyn Stark also arrives to investigate who may have attempted to kill their son Bran (who lies crippled back home in Winterfell). At this stage the intrigue is ramping up and the political game playing is kicking off chains of events which are as yet unclear. Baelish is at his best right away. His sliminess, leading you to not know if he is a hero or a villain, is played beautifully throughout every season and is evident straight away.Tyrion and Jon Snow have arrived at The Wall where Jon begins training with the highly unpleasant Ser Alliser Thorn making his life difficult. There are lovely scenes where Tyrion helps and advises Jon. Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon appear too and are acted to perfection by James Cosmo and Peter Vaughan.King Robert continues to be played with brilliant bravado by Mark Addy and Barristan Selmy provides graceful company for him and Jaime in a fun scene comparing first kills.Viserys starts to see a tougher side emerging in his younger sister as she settles a little into her place as Khaleesi of the Dothraki horde.An additional delight is the appearance of the character Syrio Forel, Arya's 'dance' teacher who is charisma personified. An absolute gem of a performance which lights up the screen while teaching Arya her first sword skills.It is interesting to view Catelyn's choices when you know the books or re-watch years later knowing how it all pans out. I feel she has a lot to answer for in her very poor decision making in this as well as later episodes. Why does she need to travel to King's Landing at all when she could have just sent Ser Rodrick? Then when she gets there she influences Ned to make mistakes and trust people he shouldn't.Another excellent episode. 9/10",

                    "content": "Grade: B+So it's interesting to hear stories about the White Walkers at this stage in the show, after having seen the entire show. I remember the intrigue and suspense around them was amazing, and a very good reason to return to the show, year after year. While it was almosy frustrating that they were teased and then slowly revealed, it did make for compelling TV, and a great overall mystery. Won't comment too much on the White Walkers themselves until I get to the episodes that involve them some more, but their introduction through the ominous dialogue here does stand out already.I suppose the talk of what lies to the far north comes with the fact that this episode is our first big introduction to the wall and the Night's Watch, which Jon Snow is joining. While the storylines around the wall and its characters often don't interest me as much as what's going on with the Starks, and what's going on in King's Landing, it is still an important part of the show. I love how it visually stands out from some of the other settings, and surprisingly, the special effects involved with showing the scale of the wall still hold up quite well, almost a decade later.King's Landing- though glimpsed in the pilot- is more formally introduced here, too. We get a sense of the politics behind the scenes, as well as the way in which the people behind the official ruler of the realm can often run things to a greater extent than said official ruler. Being introduced to interesting yet mysterious new characters- including Littlefinger and Varys- can feel overwhelming to a new viewer, but it kind of works. We're already engaged with the Starks at this point, and Ned, Arya, and Sansa are all supposed to feel a little out of their comfort zone upon arriving in King's Landing. It's entirely possible that the viewer is made to feel this way too, to have us further empathise with these particular characters.It's also nice to see Daenerys start to show some power and authority within the Dothraki clan. It's one of the first signs that she isn't helpless and na\u00efve, as she may have initially seemed. Her clashes with Viserys- where she humiliates him- are always fun to watch, and already she's showing herself as something of a force to be reckoned with. It could be seen as more or less the start of a memorable yet perhaps controversial arc for her character; I know some would disagree with me there, though.Also worth discussing is the introduction of Syrio, Arya's sword fighting mentor. I'm slightly torn, because while he's a hugely entertaining and memorable character, he does sort of clash with the world that's been established. I think he feels like he's out of The Princess Bride, which while also a fantasy story, is an entirely different kind of fantasy story. Still, he's entertaining and of course instrumental in kick-starting Arya's character arc where she progressively becomes tougher and less interested in 'traditional' feminine norms. So it's just a minor thing in all honesty; not really a complaint, just an observation.The lack of action and violence isn't noticeable in this episode, because the dialogue, backstories, and character introductions are all extremely engaging. Game of Thrones continues to build its world with fantastic and engaging detail, all the while populating it with interesting characters who each have rich histories and backstories. While it's not spectacular in a traditional sense, it is immensely satisfying and well made as a drama, and at times, that's honestly just as engaging as the biggest and flashiest battle scenes HBO's money can buy.",

                    "content": "\"Lord Snow\" is the Game of Thrones episode where most people agree that it finally came into its own. The characters we met in the first two episodes are further fleshed out and we meet some new characters who will play major roles throughout the series. We also visit King's Landing for the first time as we take our first look at the sunny capital of Westeros. What interests me, from the first three episodes, is how character-driven these episodes are. One would expect lots of action or sword-fighting from such a grand fantasy epic, but there has been limited action so far. The characters drive the plot and that is a relief because now we get to know who these characters are. The main theme here is political intrigue and I really like how the politics shape the events of Westeros and what is to come.Jon Snow takes the honor of the titular character. As we know from the first few episodes, he will be travelling to join the Night's Watch at the Wall, which separates the kingdom of Westeros and the cold, wintry North where the wildings live. Snow begins his training, but he is in for a rude awakening. He is being trained by Ser Allister, who makes Snow's life miserable. I guess that is what happens when a character is being trained to move from an arrogant rookie to a fearless leader. There is insight about how cruel life can be at the Wall. Luckily, we get another week of Tyrion at the wall. The name \"Lannister\" alone is enough to command respect of others. We see his scheming and we are left to wonder, what is his motivations? Is he in the league with Cersei and Jaime or does he have his own agenda? Peter Dinklage has been the standout of all the cast members so far and this episode is further proof. I really love his sarcastic demeanor, and I also liked how he subtly trains Snow. I also dig his bathroom off the wall routine.Let's go back to King's Landing. Ned Stark and his daughters arrive and Ned is put to work right away trying to figure out the murder of the previous Hand of the King. There are excellent character moments between Ned and Arya, played beautifully by Maisie Williams. Arya wants to be a warrior and she begins here with her sword master, Syrio Forel. The swordfighting display is a thing of beauty. I do love the interactions that Arya had with her father in this episode. The look in Ned Stark's eyes when he realizes that eventually his daughter will be a true warrior, not learning these techniques for the fun of it. Catelyn Stark also makes an appearance here. She travels to Kings Landing in secret to solve the attempt on Bran's life. There is where she runs into one of the king's advisors, Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish (played wonderfully by Aidan Gillen). Cat was Baelish's crush before she got married. They end up reuniting and Baelish tells her that the knife from the attempt was his.....until it was won off him in a game of cards by a certain a Lannister. Because of this event, things will start developing as we move forward with the season. We also meet Lord Varys, an eunuch played by Conleth Hill and Grand Master Pycelle played by Julian Glover.Speaking of Lannisters, they certainly got good lines here. Cersei is grooming her petulant son of hers to be the next king and she drives the point home in such an odd way. She gives an odd, though rather indulgent way of telling her son he is going to be king. Jaime Lannister is given more to do and is developed more here. We learn that he killed the Mad King and also has some rather chewy lines. I loved his bantering with Ned Stark as we see The Iron Throne for the first time.Finally, we head across the Narrow Sea to follow the arc of Daenary's. Daenary finally shows some qualities about why she should not be messed with. Let's just say this. Her stupid, controlling brother, Visery is going to get what he deserves. His character I completely loathe. It is nice for a change that we do not get to focus on nudity this episode. She is given nuance and she began to show why she could be a capable leader. I also like that we learn more about the Dothraki people as a whole.Overall, this is a great episode that features lots of intrigue. There may be limited action, but the tension remains on high alert. If you like political stuff, this episode will be right up your alley!My Grade: A-",

Once they reach there, Ned learns that King Robert is bankrupted and will have Sansa marry Joffrey. Meanwhile, Jon Snow undergoes training to become a member of the Night's Watch.Lord Snow is another good episode in the first season, although not the same extend as the previous two. The pacing did get a bit tedious although it does a fine job to see what would happen once the Stark family stay with King Robert and his family. And while the dialog remains a bit fresh, it's not nearly as solid as the dialog in the first two episodes. However, those are the two complaints I have with the episode because everything else turned out fine.The story is still good, the script is still well-written, the performances are still great, and once again, the scenery and music score from Ramin Djawadi are beyond beautiful. Also, the conversations between Lord Ned and King Robert is interesting enough as are the other characters including a scene where he talks to Arya about why she hates Joffrey.So, overall, not nearly as good as the first two, but another good episode.",

The last sequence with Arya brought me back to the time I was dreaming about Willow. What a refreshing ending ! And how worrying to turn her cute and joyful sword dance into a battle Ned remembered ! Is she destined to become a Joan of Arc ? Will she have to disguise as a man to fight beside her father and brothers ? Daenerys, Jon Snow\u0085 There're so many characters to care about and others like Jaime Lannister to hate ! In fact I wonder why her evil brother is still alive. A king ? He seems all alone and powerless so I really hope we'll learn more about him in the upcoming episodes. But around them we really assisted to a ballet of wonders. From the exotic environments to the artifacts TV has never felt so fantastic. Comparing it to The Lord of the Rings trilogy is nearly an insult considering that show has already grown on us and imposed its own unique identity. Moreover once the episode was over I couldn't help imagining what would happen next and it's definitely the mark of greatness. The little boy in his bed who just woke up and wants to get scared because his reality couldn't be more frightening. The old lady did a vicious job at telling the story ! And what was happening on Jon's side perfectly matched her words. But in the end beside the majestic castles and bamboos in the wind the one scene I have decided to keep gently in a corner of my mind is the heartwarming passage between Ned and Arya in her bedroom. The most inspiring father and daughter relationship ! Last but not least I already want to learn Dothraki ! The unique language definitely contributes to the authenticity of the show.",

Joffrey is like how he is thanks to his mother and the ambient he live on. He expect to do whatever he pleases in the right moment like his mother says. \"Everyone who isn't us ir our enemy.\" Arya is a promising character, negleting everything related to prince, Queen or King. It could be related with age but still. She doesn't want to be a princess and she doesn't follow normal traditions. Is like she is neglecting the world she lives on. I am intersted to see what is of her in some years. Peter Dinklage actuation is superb. I really like his tone that is charismatic and wise mixed up with some arrogance. The King doesn't particularly like the Lannister or the Kingslayer. Daenerys as the Khaleesi is growing up and even is now giving birth to a child. This 3rd epsiode is amazing starting from the scenery to the characters growing up slowly each chapter and I am especially waiting to see what \"The winter is coming\" Will bring to the table this next episodes.",

Then Syrio, Arya's \"Dancing\" instructor showed up and it became the best thing ever.Unacceptable: There might have been something I disliked, but the last scene wiped it away.Summary: Seriously, Syrio is so awesome, I can't stand it. He was in it for like.... 5 minutes, tops and he's my favorite character. The scenes on the wall were really great too, the way Tyrion subtly helps Jon. Man, I love the casting in this show.4/5",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Would like to call Season 1's fourth episode by its title, but due to it containing a prohibited word in the review guidelines (from my understanding) have decided not to in fear of guidelines violation. None of the episodes up to this point have disappointed, and this episode is not an exception. That it is very exposition-heavy and quieter in action could have easily crippled it, heavy exposition is not always kind to film and television, but this is a case of it benefiting from the exposition which does a fantastic job with developing the characters, their motivations and their backgrounds.It also doesn't suffer from trying to having too many characters and stories to introduce, \"Lord Snow\" did suffer a little from this but still managed to be a great episode because the characterisation and storytelling were still so superbly done. Not many shows have their overall quality, tones, themes and characterisations so spot on and well-established when it first starts, but 'Game of Thrones' is one of the strongest exceptions. The slower, more reflective and loose feel to the storytelling was appreciated and actually was appropriate considering the character and story density.Visually, it looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about the episode without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again, even with the odd rambling part here and there. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The monologues and exchanges all add hugely to the character development The story is paced mostly very beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Where the episode excels the most in terms of the storytelling and standout scenes is in the Night Watch scenes, where connecting with the characters was easy to do, Jon Snow's time at the Wall, Viserys and Doreah's bath scene and the final scene.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, Kit Harrington's understated charisma and Peter Dinklage's authority continue to shine, as does the affecting Emilia Clarke. Particularly good elsewhere are Michelle Fairley giving some of her career's best acting in her closing scene and the great addition of John Bradley.Overall, another wonderful episode. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

We return to John, who is fighting every day, teaching a group of ineffectual men to be soldiers (or should we say, cannon fodder). We meet a new character, Samwell Tarley, who has been disowned by his father who hopes he will die in battle. John sees in him a brother in arms (he is actually the opposite, a coward, afraid of heights, and so on). We are introduced to the joust where a knight is horribly killed. There is more intrigue involving Stark and the King. There is an exchange of war stories that shows what a lesser creature the king is. The scene ends as Tyrion and his mouth seem to be heading into another realm.",

At The Wall Jon Snow is settling into his training and stands up for new recruit Samwell Tarly; a fat lad who is frightened of everything\u0085 this leads to a speech Ser Alliser Thorne about what they can expect north of the wall went winter comes. Over the sea Viserys Targaryen makes the mistake of striking his sister and learns she will not be dominated by him anymore.In many ways this is an episode where not much really happens; it is however a series of interesting scenes that hint at things to come or tell us more about the characters. We learn why Theon Greyjoy lives with the Starks in a brief but interesting scene and Alliser Thorne's speech to Jon and Sam tells us just how bad winter can be\u0085 something we will no doubt see at some point in the series. We see that there are strong women in the story in a couple of great scenes; first when Daenerys stands up to her brother and tells Jorah Mormont that her brother will never sit on the Iron Throne and then when Catelyn Stark has Tyrion Lannister arrested; Emilia Clarke and Michelle Fairley are great in these roles. This is counterbalanced by a delightful scene between Ned and his daughter Arya where he makes it clear what is expected of her as a young woman\u0085 things that are of no interest to her. There isn't much in the way of action but as the tournament gets underway a jousting accident leads to one of the series most disturbing deaths to date as a knight gurgles blood after taking a lance to the throat.

Story threads include Ned's investigation into the death of Jon Arryn, whom he discovers was perusing a rather boring volume. A self-confessed coward, Samwell Tarly (John Bradley), experiences a rough training as he prepares for the Nights' Watch, and Jon Snow decides to protect him. Viserys raises his hand to his sister, and she vows that he'll lose both his hands if he ever does so again. And Tyrion makes the kind gesture of arranging for a special saddle to be made so that Bran can once again ride a horse.Once again, this capable cast and crew excel at world-building, and creating vivid, memorable characters. The actors simply couldn't be better, with standout monologues for the likes of Aidan Gillen (a.k.a. Baelish) and Owen Teale (a.k.a. Alliser Thorne). It's especially riveting the way that female characters such as Daenerys and Catelyn resolve on a firm course of action. The antagonists are great malevolent fun as always; Viserys is such an arrogant little p.o.s. as to have viewers eager for his eventual comeuppance.Most interesting to this viewer was much talk, in one key scene, of those magnificent flying dragons that have been discussed but not yet seen at this point in the series.Eight out of 10.",

We need to understand the background story before we can delve deep into the action.In this episode, \"Cripples, Bastards, and Broken Things,\" Ned begins his investigation of Jon Arryn's death and he learns some interesting things about Jon. Jon Snow befriends a bumbling man named Sam who is forced to join the Night Watch. Sansa refuses to speak to her father and Arya begins her sword lessons. Overseas, Daenarys shows her brother she can also exercise some authority.Overall, this is a really good episode. It may be light on the action, but the tension and intrigue remains very high.

Tyrion Lannister is a great character and Peter Dinklage is truly a great actor who seems to being the best out in everyone. I'm glad Jamie Sives is given more to do as Jory in this episode and he shares a good scene with Jamie Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau). We get another nice scene with Arya and Ned. Maisie Williams is simply stunning in her portrayal so far. Everything comes together perfectly in that scene. Not that Arya is the only one who has a moment to shine, Sophie Turner shared a good scene with Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) at Tournament and there are several good scenes with Jon and Sam. Harry Lloyd remains in top form as the arrogant Viserys, who is quickly put in his place by his sister Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) the lovely Roxanne McKee who plays Dorea looks good and I hope to see more of her, and I'm really starting to warm to Iain Glen as Ser Jorah MormontOverall this episode wasn't as good as the precious three, but thanks to Tyrion finding himself in the wrong place at the wrong time.

His importance and brilliance as a character is not really shown yet but he is endearing right from his second scene where he chats to Jon atop the wall.There are lots of scenes of dialogue which just strengthen the character development continuing to grow but it is a mostly transitional episode leading towards the next episodes where things really start to kick off.There is a nice depiction of Tyrion's decency as he shows Bran how there is still hope for him to ride and have enjoyment in life. There is a beautiful little scene between Ned and Arya which is touching and shows Arya's strength and unwillingness to conform to expectations. Gendry is introduced in a plot which leads on to forthcoming action. Scumbag Rast and Alliser Thorne continue to be villainous towards Jon as they train for the Nights Watch and Viserys continues his vileness but finally Danaerys shows the ability to strike back. There is a great scene as 'the Mountain' Gregor Clegane fights in a tournament joust and Lord Baelish slimily explains to Sansa and Arya how he burned his little brother (The Hound) disfiguring his face when they were still children. Also there is a tasty little confrontation between Ned and Cersei beautifully acted by Lena Headey.Catelyn Stark has already caused damage by riding to Kings Landing and influencing Ned to trust Lord Baelish which sets Ned up problems to come. In the final scene of this episode Cat compounds that major error as she makes another fatal mistake by taking Tyrion a prisoner for supposedly injuring Bran. He is not only the wrong person, it is a very unwise move politically and sets off a chain of tragic events basically causing the war for the seven kingdoms. Foolish and catastrophic decision making by Cat and she goes on to make numerous other similar terrible decisions. She really is the cause of all the troubles along with Baelish who is, unknown to her, pulling the strings to cause trouble. This is all brilliant and enthralling storyline taken directly from the books. It sets up the dramas to come but also makes Catelyn a character I consider a liability and a bit of an idiot. It is of course vitally important for the plot that she does these things and is great, logical story development but it destoys the sympathy or affection I might have for her character. I cannot really understand people who see Catelyn as a character they love and support. Yes she is a great character in the show but not one who I sympathise with.Not action packed or showy as an episode but all perfectly judged and acted. It is a very important set up episode for the great episodes to come.9/10",

                    "content": "Grade: BThis is probably the slowest and least eventful episode in the series so far. As such, I feel like calling it the weakest, but... it's still far from bad. It still adds to the characters, the story, and the world. It is in no way skippable. But as the first three episodes were all very strong, and the rest of the season (from memory) is even stronger, then I don't feel too bad in saying that this episode is just ever so slightly lesser, in terms of quality.I feel bad saying that though. While I don't like to rate individual TV episodes out of ten (it would clog up my movie ratings, which I mainly use IMDb for), this would probably be a 7/10, close to an 8/10 if I did give it a numerical rating. There are certainly good things about this episode, and some notable things too. Samwell is an important character in the Knight's Watch storyline, and this is the first time we see him. The final scene of the episode is also particularly good, giving Catelyn another opportunity to clash against a popular, likable character without having the audience turn against her (at least I don't imagine people will dislike her). We're given an explanation as to why she believes Littlefinger, even though we already know at this point he seems suspicious, and so we can't blame her for calling for Tyrion's arrest in an effective cliffhanger.Speaking of Tyrion: he really has been a highlight of the show so far, creating a great impression right from early in the series. He has many great lines, an entertaining and snarky attitude, and Peter Dinklage's charm is undeniable. From memory he won an Emmy for his work in this first season, which was more than deserved.This episode does, however, feel a tad reliant on explaining things from the past. As the last two episodes also did a lot of that, this style of storytelling is perhaps starting to wear slightly thin. Thankfully, the plot is soon to pick up and get very exciting, so I'd advise anyone feeling a little underwhelmed at this point to stick with the show. The exposition does serve a purpose, and viewers will be rewarded for their patience.I do also like how many characters who haven't shown up yet have been getting their names dropped. People like Tywin Lannister, Walder Frey, and Mance Raydar, among others. It just builds the world up so well, knowing that there are other interesting people out there who have had an influence on the world of Westeros, who we're yet to meet as viewers. I'm not sure what I thought about hearing all these names as a first time viewer, but it's a lot of fun hearing them as somebody watching the show for a second time now.The last thing worth noting is the brutality in that jousting scene towards the episode's end. We know people can die in this show, but here it's driven home that deaths can be shocking in their visceral goriness too. Someone dying by way of losing a joust in most other medieval stories would not die as slowly, or as bloodily, as the knight does in this episode. This can be considered another warning for the squeamish: you are going to see some horrifically violent stuff, should you continue to watch. And this is only the beginning, after all...",

                    "content": "This fourth episode is another worthy episode in the early goings of Game of Thrones. It is an episode mainly filled with exposition and stories, and that is what intrigued me. Many episodes that has nothing but stories tend to get crushed under such weight, but not here. Each actor is capable of telling these history-based stories in their own way. The history is fiction of course, but I couldn't have been more enthralled listening about how past events shaped the current world of Westeros. I am sure some people may be bored, but I can promise that learning about dragons or hearing stories about cannibalism is far from boring. Such stories have a poetic feel to them. For example, let's talk about Visery's dialogue. He was telling his lady friend, Doreah about how his father made him memorize the names of the old dragons and would give him sweets if he memorized them.If anything, the plot is advanced forward even more regarding the Starks. Ned continues his research, amongst a bunch of old books and genealogies, into what may have caused Jon Arryn's death. Despite that, he is still pressured with the politics of Westeros. When he could be doing his research, King Robert has him figuring out security for a pointless jousting match. Ned has to know that everyone has eyes on him tracking his every move. In a lovely conversation with Littlefinger, he tells Ned that he should trust no one and he points out the spies from the likes of himself, Varys (known as the Spider), and Cersei.The scenes with Arya are becoming more impressive by the episode. Maisie Williams is an incredibly gifted actress. She has a scene with Ned where she asks if Bran will be okay and he responds that he will be a lord one day and so will she. She tells him that is not her life. This series resembles the Middle Ages and women don't have much say about who they are. Either you can be a whore or a lady, not much in between. So I love how Arya know what she wants. She continues her sword training and these scenes are still delightful. Apparently, she will be chasing cats because they are nimble creatures! As for Sansa, she is still angry with Ned because of the direwolf incident. She does have an interesting conversation with Baelish when he tells her a story about Sandor 'The Hound\" Clegane and how he received his atrocious scars as a child from the hands of his older brother.Let's go to the North and check in with Jon Snow. He is partnered with the fat, bumbling Samwell Tarly (played by John Bradley). The stories atop the Wall are strong. Tarly has not fought a day in his life and he is only here because his father forced him to dress in black or he would be killed. Then of course while conversing, Ser Allister comes to them and mentions a story about how cold it is in the North during Winter and what they had to do to survive. Frightening stuff to hear, although Allister told his story out of spite. I love how Jon takes the mantle of doing the right thing and how he uses his direwolf to threaten anyone who makes fun of Sam.Finally, we go across the Narrow Sea. We see better what drives Viserys although his villain portrayal is still \"mustache-twirling\" to coin a phrase. But now he and the audience see that Daenarys is in charge and she knows it. I loved her threat about if he touches her again, he will have no hands. You go, Daenarys!Overall, this is an episode mainly filled with exposition. The series prides itself on its history so we learn new history stuff all the time, which is fine by me although it can be quite the dangerous game to play. Aiden Gillen is fantastic and quite funny. And of course Peter Dinklage. His character takes somewhat of a backseat, but he has some good lines regarding a saddle for Bran and insulting Theon Greyjoy. He is also involved in the cliffhanger, so be prepared! This episode is quite fun and thrilling!My Grade: A",

                    "content": "Once the ending credits roll you'll realize you're shaking. Fear ? Admiration ? Anger ? The wicked emotions this fourth episode should make you feel could be a first for your televisual experience. With the characters gradually growing on us their every scenes seem more authentic and pivotal. Since the pilot we know that everything can change in a few split seconds. One minute the little boy was climbing, the next he is a cripple. So Game of the Thrones play in the same league of masterpieces like Dexter and Lost, shows that have pushed the quality barrier far beyond its audience expectations. I'm talking about these memorable moments when you forget it's actually TV. And when it comes to convey such extreme after effects no one can deny that talents like Michael C. Hall, Jennifer Carpenter, Terry O'Quinn and Matthew Fox of course are the first names that pop up in your head as best examples. I should also mention Spartacus : Blood and Sand considering how much I praised the show and Andy Whitfield's performance but it wouldn't be reasonable. At least it's the trembling resonance the acting had on me this time.The first impact came from Emilia Clarke as Daenerys and Harry Lloyd as Viserys. The last bathtub sequence was surprising, sensual and more important very enlightening. Indeed it allowed us to learn more about the fantasy elements that populate the kingdoms, specially the legendary dragons, and unveiled the evil brother backstory. But it's really when he tried to dominate his sister again that you should feel the ground quaking beneath your seat. And don't get wrong, it's really happening. In your stars or in your skull, don't pretend you can resist her. The second impact would be what happened in the cold winter arc. Jon Snow's story is so dark and disturbing ! It's the perfect counter poison to the others even if I also expect storm and other destructive elements to unleash their fury on our friends and foes. The speech Snow and his new chubby buddy were given was horrific and even more frightening than the dark fairytale the creepy grandma told little Bran. Winter is Coming ? It seems even Ned could be underestimating what it really means. Last but not least the third impact, that also served as a cliffhanger, was definitely Catelyn Stark's escape at the inn. They couldn't have made a better choice than casting Michelle Fairley as Ned's wife. Like Sean Bean she had already impressed us but this installment you'll learn why people call her Lady Stark. It was pure grace and strength put into motion. It also revealed what really separates some Starks from some Lannisters, because they aren't all just black or white.Between two shakes there was still plenty of room for entertaining and interesting stuff. Arya's role was minor this time but her little chat with her father was refreshing and definitely intriguing. What a cute and fierce portrayal of the inevitable Joan of Arc she should become ! I don't know about her destiny considering I haven't read the novel yet but I can't see how she could restrain herself to just become a pretty queen. Once all grown up she could be to the show who Deedlit is to Record of Lodoss War, a beautiful and inspiring female warrior. An other element I quite enjoyed was Ned's lecture in the park about trust and issues. As for his dangerous mind game with Cersei Lannister, played by the delicate Lena Headey, my only complain would be about the lighting. In fact it's not the first time I have noticed the issue, that its whiteness is far too artificial. It's slightly disappointing because other than that the production is an immersion model and surely a delight for graphics whores and other amateurs of fine arts. And should I even mention the dreamy title sequence ? To conclude a mandatory sequence, when it comes to medieval fiction, was also featured and even if I found it a little rushed it was definitely exciting and was also the perfect occasion to learn more about an enigmatic character we knew nothing about until now.",

                    "content": "This is again an episode that doesn't include big stuff (well, we've got a joust, that's something) or surprises in the plot, however, I still liked it more than the two before because there's not much that seems unnecessary in this episode. John Bradley, who plays the new guy at the Night's Watch, really exaggerated his role as this useless coward that gets bullied there and I thought they focused on this story too much. Therefore I'm glad that Jon Snow and the Night's Watch are completely absent in the next episode. But since they used the lots of scenes there to get the audience acquainted with the heavy life that lies ahead of Jon and his colleagues and they also portrayed his kindness very well, it was nothing that bored or actually annoyed me. Another character that gets way too much attention is Littlefinger, but that didn't bother me since Aidan Gillen plays him very interestingly. The other flaw of this episode would be some writing weaknesses since there are also a lot of changes to the novel in this episode. Lena Headey and Mark Addy really got too little screen time in this episode with the latter only having about two sentences in the whole 55 minutes, but I understand that it's not at all easy to include so many characters in every episode. The crew created a stunning visual style as always and I thought they did really well with exposing things and developing characters. The fight scene of Daenerys and Viserys would be the best example for this, though Harry Lloyd overacts his part just as in the episode before this one. I mean, we get that his character is both a jerk and a coward, he doesn't have to illustrate that in every single scene he's in. The outstanding scenes in this episode were Cersei and Ned's little conversation and Bran getting to do something again, while the outstanding cast members are rather hard to name. I would say that the women are more interesting in this episode, notably Michelle Fairley (who has a really great final scene with Peter Dinklage) and Emilia Clarke who both can really exhibit self-confidence.",

Tyrion gives Bran an idea of something that even someon that can't walk can use to ride a horse. Tyrion might be aggressive, go directly to the point and push many buttons in the ones he talks. But he speaks the truth that no one dare to say even if is not welcomed. The character grows on me because even if he is too aggressive about things he had it hard. His father never liked him because he is a dwarf and yet he have a soft spot in his hearth that has grown in me. \"You will marry a high lord and rule his castle. And your sons shall be knights and princess and lords. No. That's not me. \" From Arya I am expectant about who will she become in the future. \"I don't like high places. You can't fight. You can't see. You're afraid of heights and almost everything else probably. What are you doing here, Sam? On the morning of my 18th nameday, my father came to me. \"You're almost a man now,\" he said. \"But you're not worthy of my land and title. Tomorrow, you're going to take the black, forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north. If you do not,\" he said, \"then we'll have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and you'll be thrown from your saddle to die. Or so I'll tell your mother. Nothing would please me more.\" I hope he gets his vengeance not in form of blood. But becoming an important soldier of the Night's Watch. The King makes Jaime listen behind the door when he makes sex with his sisters and others. It seems like the Queen being Lannister didn't help them much. The horse war \"destrier\" tournament. The hound older brother killed a man by his throat. The reason the hound have half of a face burned is because his older brother burned him down when they were young. \"I was also trained to kill my enemies, Your Grace. As was I.\" A direct threat by Ned to which Cercei reply. Which was practically a declaration of war. What a cliffhanger! Lady Stark should gad waited for more proof... This little man is innocent. I am expectant to see how he slip out of this.",

Maybe just a little gay and a lot of awesome.It seems like seasons don't rotate like they normally do. Summer and winters don't have a specific timeline they keep too. I'm guessing the hardcore dudes from episode 1 are the white walkers who are going to mess shiz up in the winter time, which at this point I'm fine with because some of these people after the throne are really starting to bug me.Ah, The Mountain makes his first appearance.

So that part was good, because it looks like Ned will find out something interesting later in the season. Let's see what happens in the next chapters.Now, about his daughter Arya, it doesn't look natural that she, being an infant girl, wants to be a knight, and her father lets her believe in that fantasy. Probably Ned is thinking in something else, and just doesn't want to contradict her, but it's unnatural that in the Middle Ages, an infant girl would behave like that. This is why this episode is not a 10.On the other hand, Jon Snow is very unhappy at the Night Wall, so he does odd things to go against his superior, who is a gray-haired nobleman, apparently.Across the sea, Daenerys and her brother fight and he ends up humiliated. Funny scene. It makes sense what Daenerys, the Khaleesi, says: He doesn't deserve the throne of the Seven Kingdoms. He is just a whining spoiled effeminate man. And she starts to realize that. He wouldn't be a good leader at all. This is the perfect representation of the decadence of the almost extinct House of Targaryen.Finally, the final scene, which actually looked a bit dumb (another negative point added to the final rate): Lady Stark, Ned's wife, does something many would have not predicted, and it does not make much sense that the people at that tavern obeys her. Like, why? Although she is the ruler of the North's wife, she has no authority to command something dangerous: arrest a member of the Lannister House, the house of the same queen of the Seven Kingdoms. It just didn't look natural. Plus all this scene added a bit of sensationalism, which is not always necessary.",

It was odd that as I watched it, I was enjoying everything but as the credits rolled, I felt like I hadn't watched anything worth remembering.

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Wolf and the Lion\" is one of the best episodes of the first season, is classic 'Game of Thrones' and there is the agreement that it is the best episode since \"Winter is Coming\". Actually loved the quieter and heavier in exposition episodes in between, but things feel more focused and tighter here and things are more action-packed in a way that's exciting and intriguing and there is also plenty of character development that is rich and layered, Sean Bean and Mark Addy's scenes are particularly note-worthy.It has been commented by critics that the omission of the Night Watch and Dothraki scenes was a good move that made the story more focused and succinct and that the changes from the source material, mainly additions, were bold and made things feel more rounded. Have to completely agree with this. As well as some of the most exciting action scenes and best effects and visuals of the whole show, it was those aspects that were particularly striking about \"The Wolf and the Lion\". The dragon skulls and the Eyrie were standouts.Visually, \"The Wolf and the Lion\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about the episode without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The monologues and exchanges all add hugely to the character development. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, although the acting is uniformly good across the board Sean Bean, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Mark Addy are knockouts.Overall, phenomenal and what 'Game of Thrones' is all about. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The expediency comes in trying to outwit not just your obvious enemies but, in some cases, those that are superficially loyal. The Hand, Lord Stark, is trying hard to be loyal to friend and kind. The king wants to have absolute power but is a fat lazy slob who is only good at shouting orders. His \"marriage\" is just that and there is no love involved at all. Tyrion is with Lady Stark who believes that he is responsible for the near death of Bran. She takes him to her wacko sister after he saves her life in a battle. He is left on a precipice/prison cell with few options. The king orders Lord Stark to murder the sister and brother who are riding with the barbarians. He assumes they will ultimately ride against the king whose soldiers have grown soft and displaced. Lots to think about going into the sixth episode.",

However the group is attacked by a hill tribe and Tyrion protects Catelyn. Meanwhile Ned discovers dangerous secrets in King's Landing and Arya overhears two men in the dungeons plotting a war and the assassination of her father. There is a meeting of King Robert and the small council and the king orders Ned to kill Daenerys, her unborn son and Viserys, but he replies that this would be a dishonorable assignment and resigns to his position of King's Hand. He goes to a Littlefinger's brothel and finds a bastard son of Robert. When he leaves the place, Jaime is waiting for him with a little army because he heard about the imprisonment of Tyrion. They slaughter Ned's guards and Ned is stabbed on the back on his leg. \"The Wolf and the Lion\" is an episode full of action and intrigues in King's Landing. Ned learns how dangerous is the King's Hand position and for the first time he confronts the Machiavellian Robert. The cunning Tyrion will certainly find a way to revert his situation. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"The Wolf and the Lion\"",

If that weren't bad enough Arya overhears two men plotting against her father then Ned loses his most important ally, the King, when he refuses to back the king's plan to have Daenerys Targaryen murdered before she gives birth. Away from the capital Catelyn Stark takes Tyrion to her sister's castle; the Eyrie.We may not visit The Wall or travel over the Narrow Sea in this episode but that doesn't matter as there is so much going on in King's Landing; everybody seems to be scheming and trying to determine who their allies will be\u0085 not easy when alliances are based on picking who you think will come out on top rather than trust or friendship. The episode is top and tailed by some fine action sequences; both of which include shocking moments; including the decapitation of a horse and a man getting a sword thrust through his head! The cast continues to excel; here Sean Bean does particularly well demonstrating he can do action as well as subtle emotion. He has a couple of great scenes with Mark Addy's King Robert; firstly a humorous one where he mocks his friends inability to fit into his armour then the more serious one where we see that friendship has its limits and the King is furious that The Hand won't back his murderous plan. This episode proved to be an interesting introduction to Catelyn's sister; she is clearly one of the maddest characters yet; she is still breast feeding her son who appears to be eight or nine! Other scenes worthy of not include a frank talk between the king and his wife, an talk between Lords Baelish and Varys and an amusing scene between Arya and a couple of guards. Overall a top notch episode that hints at things to come; there is a fair amount of violence, swearing, sex and nudity but I suspect anybody put off by that would have dropped the series by now!",

Ned Stark is taken aback at his Kings' reaction to the news of Daenerys' pregnancy; the King now wants her and her offspring dead. A disgusted Ned then resigns from his position as Kings' Hand. Meanwhile, Catelyn takes her prisoner Tyrion to her sister Lysa (Kate Dickie) for punishment, only to receive a stern rebuke. Finally, an incensed Jaime confronts Ned about Tyrions' predicament, leading to an ugly scene indeed.'The Wolf and the Lion' is typically compelling entertainment, done with style and also a large amount of wit. This episode can be quite amusing at times. It also carries some real weight in the dialogue-heavy scenes between characters, such as a moment with the King and Cersei Lannister.This viewer is not one to complain about the level of brutality; rather, he feels that it adds an incredible visceral quality. It may be disturbing to more squeamish viewers, but it adds to the overall impact of the storytelling. It helps to create this idea of a world that is harsh and uncompromising.As for those sexual elements, well, none are more twisted than our introduction to Lysa; if anybody reading this is familiar with the trashy 1981 Italian zombie film \"Burial Ground\", they may experience a feeling of deja vu.This viewer may be late to the party in terms of checking out this series, but so far he's enjoyed what he's seen.Eight out of 10.",

I was slightly disappointed we do not see Daenerys or the Dothrackis in this episode, although they are used in context. I liked this episode because you can see the rivalry between the Stark and the Lannister family as they are always in each others throat as they try to be the number one family in the kingdom.In this episode, \"The Wolf and the Lion,\" King Robert learns that the Dothrakis are going to bring war to the kingdom, so he plans to murder Vaenerys. Ned Stark brings the anger out of the king when he refuses. Arya overhears of a plot against her father. As Ned leaves Kings Landing, he runs into some trouble. Meanwhile, Catelyn Stark brings her prisoner, Tyrion to her sister's keep, where she happens to be the widow of Jon Arryn.Overall, this is another solid early entry in the Game of Thrones catalog. I really enjoyed the episode, particularly the rivalry between the Lannisters and the Starks which culminates in an epic sword battle towards the end. I did find the little kid who played the son of Catelyn's sister quite annoying, but other than that the acting was really good.My Grade: A-",

There is a brilliant exchange between Varys and Littlefinger too, an then of course we have the ending. Another great ending. This is an episode that really shows Sean Bean's gift both for the physical side of acting and the emotional side. His Eddard carrying the weight of his disappointments and his honour to do his duty on his shoulders.Then there is his fight against Jaime Lannister. I need to praise Bean and Coaster-Waldau for their performance here; Coaster-Waldau especially carries off Jaime's cockiness\u0085 and his rage when a fair single combat is disrupted. But Mark Addy? I've not been a fan of him in this show, however there is Brilliant acting on his part. Especially his rage at Ned.",

The excellent dialogue is delivered with panache and the scenes are skillfully put together with tension building and an exciting cliffhanger scene at the end.There are a lot of fabulous scenes between characters. A lot are adapted closely from the book with Varys, Littlefinger, Pycelle, King Robert, Cersei and Ned all entwined in political duelling in King's Landing and little Arya exploring the dungeons. One scene added to that part entirely created by screenwriters Benioff and Weiss is the lovely scene between Robert and Cersei where they discuss their relationship. It fits in really well and adds wonderfully to the overall superb quality.The journey for Catelyn taking Tyrion to the Eyrie is a very shortened version compared to the book but works really well, maintaining the main important aspects and adding to the character of Tyrion who by now is established as a favourite. The start of the humorous banter with sellsword Bron is already adding quality humour and Peter Dinklage imbues Tyrion with all the attributes required for the fine role.The climactic face off where things start to develop towards war is rather different to the book version in detail but keeps the essence of it and is really brilliantly and excitingly done.The emotional impact achieved in only the 5th episode is great and the makers prove they have successfully translated the intrigue, the heart and the top standards that is contained in the book version.This is where the series hits full stride. 10/10.",

                    "content": "Grade: A-Before this episode, there was certainly conflict and a great deal of tension between House Stark and House Lannister. Yet here in episode 5, things get physical, and as such, the rivalry blossoms into something with true life and death stakes. As such, this could be seen as a point in season 1 where things get very, very serious, and the momentum from the climactic fight sequence will be sustained and then some for the remaining five episodes (to say nothing of how the second half of the season paves the way for the seasons that follow, but to go off on that tangent would mean getting way ahead of myself).Ned and Jaime clashed verbally prior to this episode, but in this episode they clash physically. Tyrion's arrest by Catelyn has caused the Lannisters to really lose their cool, and even though Tyrion did not try to murder Bran, it's hard to feel bad for Jaime at this point. If he hadn't pushed Bran out the window, there would have been no need for the Lannisters to attempt a murder, and as such, Tyrion would have never been falsely accused. Jaime brought this upon himself, so it's extra frustrating to see him essentially win the battle at the episode's end. Ned Stark has a spear shoved through his leg, as well as several of his men (including Jory) murdered. The episode ends with him passing out in shock. Things just got extremely real for our protagonist, and that's without even taking into account his dramatic clash with King Robert in this very same episode.We get some more intense action when Catelyn, Tyrion, and the other characters travelling with them are attacked. Tyrion goes out of his way to protect Catelyn, killing a bandit that was about to murder her. His unusual method of applying a shield to the man's head repeatedly is memorably graphic, but once the shock wears off, you do realise that it shows the good in Tyrion. He could have easily sat back and let somebody kill Catelyn, but he saves her- hopefully she's appreciative of this in time, too.Then at the episode's start we get a clash between the Clegane brothers, after The Mountain chops the head off his horse. Extremely violent episode overall, all things considered, but that shouldn't surprise first time viewers too much at this stage... and it definitely shouldn't surprise viewers like me who are rewatching the series.Memorable sequences of violence and combat aside, there are less action-packed scenes that have a real impact in this episode, too. With both Daenerys and Jon Snow sitting this episode out, there's a particularly large emphasis on King's Landing, and all the wonderful suspicion and intrigue that comes with it. The conversation between Littlefinger and Varys is a particular highlight, with each trying to outsmart and get 'one up' on the other, and it's a particular delight at this early stage of the show to watch two morally shady characters engage in a type of combat that is instead verbal in nature.The early seasons of Game of Thrones are beloved because of this kind of verbal sparring and interesting dialogue, and it is a delight to watch it again. As this episode strikes such a good balance between the political intrigue + shady characters and action (not to mention some great special effects and imagery when Catelyn and Tyrion arrive at The Vale), it's not difficult to call this the best episode of the show's run to this point.Even better, season 1 just gets even more exciting and engaging from here on out...",

When his daughter Arya (Maisie Williams) glimpses at a disguised Varys (Conleth Hill) plotting with the same man who interacted with the Targaryens a few episodes ago, we start to genuinely appreciate the scale of the series and the intrigues between the surface, with dark machinations ticking like the gears of the superb title sequence.Both spymaster Varys and social climber Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) take shape as fearsomely skilled players. Other notable scenes are a bitter heart-to-heart conversation between King Robert (Mark Addy) and Queen Cersei (Lena Headey), providing nuance to a relationship made of mutual loathing, and the confrontation between Ned and Jaime Lannister (Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau), the latter beginning to show glimpses of humanity under his smug facade.7/10",

The tension is mounting thanks to the sharp script, exhilarating action sequences, great direction from Brian Kirk, and fantastic acting all-around (with Sean Bean and Mark Addy sharing the MVP award for the episode). The episode really kicks it into high-gear and there were some choices that surprised me considering this is only the fifth episode. For example, I did not expect Ned Stark to step down from his Hand of the King role so soon. I was expecting some kind of action in this regard later in the season, but not too soon. Mark Addy has some fantastic monologues, one with Ned and one with his wife, Cersei. Both monologues show just how vulnerable the king's character is. I was most interested in his conversation with Cersei. They admitted their hate....and their love to each other that lasted for seventeen years. In an episode with rising tension and an incredible battle sequence, these lines of dialogue stand out to me.In this episode \"The Wolf and the Lion,\" King Robert gathers his advisors and tells them of his plan to kill Daenary because he believes she will take the Dothraki horde and take them across the Narrow Sea to invade King's Landing. Ned refuses to comply, which creates a heated argument between the two friends, and it ends with Ned stepping down. As Ned is about to leave the capital, he finds a clue in regard to the death of the prior Hand with Robert's illegitimate son. Meanwhile, Arya overhears a plot against her father. Catelyn, who kidnapped Tyrion last episode, takes him as prisoner for her older sister, widow of the previous Hand, and leader of the Vale, Lysa Arryn. With news of Tyrion's kidnapping reaching King's Landing, Jaime Lannister confronts Ned Stark as he is about to leave.The acting is tremendous across the board. I already mentioned how great Mark Addy was, but Sean Bean deserves lots of credit. He makes his point about murdering a mother with an unborn child as immoral. I really liked his bold move quitting his position. This episode allows us to see the views from both sides and allows us to be sympathetic to both sides. I also love Tyrion's arc here, and I love how his sardonic personality is on display despite his unfortunate kidnapping.Another new kingdom was introduced to us here, and that was the Vale. The fortress is impenetrable, and it has a cool-looking prison on a ledge, but its ruler, Lysa (played by Kate Dickey) is crazy! Maybe I am being too kind calling her crazy. The episode introduces her to the viewers by breast-feeding her six-year-old son, Robyn. Apparently, Catelyn and Lisa haven't seen each other in five years....and that is pretty obvious in their meeting. Their sequences are short, but it's well-worth it. I think Robyn was annoying, but one can forgive thanks to the actions of the mother.Overall, this is a fantastic episode. I loved all this political dueling, in a sense. Robert, Cersei, Ned, Baelish, Varys, Catelyn, Robert's brother, Renly all have different kinds of political motivation. Their interactions with each other is the main reason why this episode is so tense and works so well. The monologue between Varys and Baelish is also worth a mention as we see they may have a plan about King Robert. Also, the humorous wordplay between Tyrion and sell-sword Bronn are well worth watching. Bronn will be a pivotal character in episodes to come. There is some gay representation here , thanks to Renly and the king's servant, Lancel. Lancel is someone the king is not entirely fond of as we see when from some of the dialogue. Also, I will mention the end battle between Ned and Jaime. That was some fancy sword work in action, plus a wonderful cliffhanger ending! Another episode, another win!My Grade: A",

It brings some more character development to not only the Stark family, but the other characters as well while having some very neat action sequences. And that's a good thing since it has a nice balance between character study and action. My only quibble is that it left me wanting to see more of how Tyrion will handle his predicament when he got arrested for his rumored crimes against Bran Stark.Everything else is done well. The acting continues to shine from all of the actors' performances especially Eddard who has a sense of humanity to him under his smug face when he chose not to kill Daenerys. The story is well-written, the script is smart, the dialog is excellent, the music score is still amazing, and it has a much fine pacing this time around.Overall, great episode and a great improvement.",

So much violence was almost refreshing and the swordfights were brutal, specially the one with the wicked brothers, and well choreographed. The end was specially shocking considering how much Ned had grown on us in the past episodes. One minute you're the hand of the king, the next you're left for dead in a dark alley. I can't wait to see how they'll respond even if Lady Stark definitely made the wrong move by kidnapping the dwarf ! However it allowed us to discover a whole new side of her life\u0085 her mentally disturbed sister ! From the disturbing milking session to the vertiginous dungeon it was reminiscent of epic fantasy productions like Willow and Conan of course ! Let's hope the prisoner isn't a snack for some creepy flying creature ! In general I really enjoyed the confusing way relationships are developed. They're all wicked and I have no idea who are the true friends and who are the evil foes. My only disappointment was that I missed Daenerys but at least the two gay men reminded me of Viserys because of one's resemblance with him. In fact it's interesting that so many sexual aspects are covered : Raw and wild ride with a hot female slave, androgynous characters\u0085 There're so many elements to blur the lines and that definitely makes the show even deeper !",

Okay, I get that CGI did the heavy lifting, but cutting off the head of a horse with the groan and slow descent to the dirt made me sick to my stomach. What's wrong with you people? How does anyone find any of this acceptable in any way? Entertaining in any way? The acting is superb, yes. The costuming and sets are beyond compare. And the landscapes are breathtaking, but everything else is utterly sickening. I watch hundreds of episodes of many shows every year, but this show is like eye candy for sadistic psychopaths. And by the way, if you're interested in the minds of such people, watch Mindhunter. Brilliant without all the graphic animal and human cruelty.",

Turns out Arya is better at being in the mafia than both of them, which makes me roll my eyes, but it looks like everyone else is starting to acknowledge how good of a son she is turning out to be. And we're introducing a new kingdom, I was starting to wonder where these seven kingdoms were going to come from.King finally gets it together just in time to declare war on the dude's who are clearly way more hardcore than his people. Although riding The Mountain into battle against Drogo would be pretty epic. Stark calls him on it and rolls out, but woah, 10 year old still sucking the boob...King apparently fully realizes his kingdom is crap, but is too heartbroken to care at all. The queen has known all along and he has never felt anything for her (still doesn't give her a pass for banging her brother on the regular). Speaking of her brother, he sucks.",

One can see the decadence of the Capital of the Seven Kingdoms, with all the lords conspiring against each other, while the fool king is indeed a fool, and is easily manipulated by the royal council. Then Ned Stark does a very bad decision at going against his king and friend, as he had honor. Honor is used as a virtue for being an obstinate compassionate fool. That's not the real meaning of honor, but it looks like the episode shows honor like that.On the other hand, a matriarchal kingdom is shown when Lady Stark, after apprehending the Lannister dwarf, heads towards a kingdom in the middle of the mountain, where her sister rules there. But what kind of place it is! Full matriarchy, with a spoiled little prince whining about non sense, and being breastfed by her mother when he is already about 10 years old! Good thing: A good example of how a kingdom can degenerate at such level.In the end, Ned receives what he was supposed to receive. His men are killed by an intriguing character I won't mention now if I don't want my review to contain spoilers.",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.'Game of Thrones' first season continues to keep going from strength to strength. There is not a bad episode for me in the first season and \"A Golden Crown\" is among its better ones. \"A Golden Crown\" is closer to the more focused and tightly paced sort of stories than to the quieter in action and more reflective ones, the latter's been actually very well on 'Game of Thrones' but the richer and more layered storytelling and characterisation do fare a little better for me.\"A Golden Crown\" is particularly noteworthy for the parts dealing with the Dothraki and also the moral dilemma of the way of ruling and fighting for honour and justice. The episode is also worth seeing for the powerful ending alone. Note of warning, \"A Golden Crown\" is not for the easily squeamish, definitely watch it before eating anything.Visually, \"A Golden Crown\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"A Golden Crown\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The monologues, Peter Dinklage has a particularly great one, and exchanges all add hugely to the character development. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, the acting is hard to find faults. Peter Dinklage and Sean Bean are as always marvellous. Harry Lloyd provides a masterclass in how to humanise a villain and do it superbly, while Emilia Clarke shows that the more her role further expands and gets more interesting the more maturity there is.In conclusion, another wonderful episode. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

By now the show is deadly serious and thoroughly bloody with most if not all of the main characters in perilous situations. Ned attempts to navigate the murky waters of Kings Landing while Tyrion undergoes his first trial by combat, which is something really special and makes the excellent Jerome Flynn stand out for the first time. The script is really written and full of drama, but the real highlight is the Dothraki storyline, which comes to a sudden head at the climax with one of the best scenes in the show's history.",

We see her brother invade a world where he is an alien but doesn't get it. Ned maintains his morality as his wife goes off, causing problems. We have his daughter, betrothed to the king, acting in her selfish, childish way. Bran almost gets it. Most of the children, including that awful suckling child, are really selfish and full of themselves.

Tyrion is still captive in the Eyrie and demands that he be given a trial as is his right under the King's Law\u0085 as he knows he won't get a fair hearing he opts for trial by combat hoping they will wait for Jaime to get there to fight as his champion; they don't but another man stands up for him and he is prepared to fight dirty. Across the Narrow Sea Viserys is frustrated to see the way the people adore his sister and impatient to receive the golden crown he was promised; he should have been wary of the proverb 'be careful what you wish for; you might just get it'!I think this was my favourite episode yet; it is packed with some great scenes\u0085 so many that it is hard to believe they all come from a single episode! The most memorable scene is of course the finale where we see Viserys get his crown; not only is it shocking, it is also important as it demonstrates that this series isn't afraid to kill of apparently major characters and shows just how tough Daenerys has become; both Harry Lloyd and Emilia Clarke were on top form. Other highlights include a brilliant scene between Maisie Williams and Miltos Yerolemou as Arya and her 'dance instructor' Syrio Forel and an utterly hilarious scene where Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister confesses\u0085 not to the crime he was accused of but to a variety of sexual matters starting at a surprisingly young age! These are just a few of the highlights in this great episode; an episode that was as much fun watching the second time as the first thanks to some subtle hints of things to come.",

Good reddens to bad rubbish, even if he was blond and called himself some dragon. And while Viserys receives the crown, his sister-very pregnant and unwilling to look away no matter how much voice of reason, the loyal Jorah Mormont, requests-Daenerys holds her head high, declaring him as no dragon. This comes after Viserys tried to snatch the dragon eggs to pay for *another* army and supplies, with Jorah standing in his way and Daenerys impressively gobbles up an entire horse heart without vomit! Clearly Daenerys has surpassed her bossy, demanding brother, allowing him to die before her without argument. Daenerys is now officially Khaleesi and she has named her child, RhaegarTyrion was in quite a pickle. Captured and imprisoned at Lysa's castle prison, designed to tilt slightly in order to potentially dump those who sleep to their doom, Tyrion seriously needs to escape this situation pronto, doing so when he appeals to his captors for a trial by combat. Lucky for Tyrion, Bronn will happily oblige while Lysa firmly considers her supposedly greatest, honorable knight, Vardis Egen, quite capable of finishing this without much concern. However, Bronn doesn't fight honorable, or even with shield, and uses whatever sneaky tactics he needs to in order to survive and vanquish Egen. Cat and Lysa have no choice but to watch as Tyrion is freed of his shackles, Bronn agreeably satisfied with his victory. Certainly for Bronn, helping a Lannister has its rewards.It is all going to hell at King's Landing, though. The Lannisters sending out The Mountain and soldiers to attack Cat's Tully people, Ned Stark investigating Joffrey who is the \"blond prince\" when all of the Baratheons are black-haired, Ned condemning The Mountain and stripping him of his title and prestige while also demanding Tywin's (Cersei's father, who husband Robert is deeply in debt to) presence at the throne, Cersei demanding Ned pay for his temporary combat with her brother, Robert striking Cersei for her harsh words towards him (questioning the manhood of Robert Baratheon, telling him perhaps she should wear the crown and him the gown!), Ned preparing his daughters (Arya doesn't wish to quit her sword lessons while Sansa has patched things up with Joffrey and wishes to marry only him) for a return to Winterfell, and Jaime currently gone from his post due to engaging with Ned; all of these developments leading us to the inevitable doom of both Ned and Robert.With marauders attempting to take Bran's horse (and trying to remove him from it!) as Robb attempts to interfere, with Greyjoy ultimately assisting with his bow/arrow; the Starks are scattered and often facing surrounding peril/tensions within the Seven Kingdoms. While Theon Greyjoy tries and fails to keep his favorite prostitute from leaving Winterfell, his attempts to convince Robb to wage war on the Lannisters also proves unsuccessful.All of this intrigue continues to build towards the first season finale, but Ned and Robert's time in King's Landing is drawing to a close. Robert unable to halt the efforts of his Hand from stirring up the Lannisters (who often get their way because of the depths they are willing to sink) will not end well for either of them. While all of this is building towards Joffrey securing the crown, Daenerys has strengthened herself into a Queen.The little ironies: Joffrey \"apologies\" and \"recommits\" to Sansa, as Septa Mordane looks on. Sansa is essentially the Stark version of Joffrey, speaking down to Mordane, disregarding her history and presence. That Tyrion was responsible for the design of the saddle that Bran uses to ride his white horse and yet stand trial for the assassin using his dagger. Robert brags about being a great soldier, missing the battles and combat, taken to task by his younger brother, Renly, for celebrating a time where many died, dragons attacked cities, and the Mad King burned alive innocent people. Arya given sage advice from Syrio, her sword trainer, to remember that the only god to fear is death...and she does often avoid this god despite death's efforts to have her. Littlefinger's influence during a small council meeting on Ned, resulting in further estrangement of the Lannisters...the results of this leading to \"off with his head!\"",

Robb proves himself quite capable of combat when saving the life of Bran from some forest-dwelling rogues.All of these actors are just so damn good that they completely sell this material, especially when you have thespians like Harry Lloyd as Viserys that get the viewer all fired up about hating their character. Granted, locations such as \"The Wall\", and some of the characters, take a back seat this time around, but that is good as it gives more screen time to people like Robb. Adding to the entertainment value is the fact that Ned does some more reading, and comes to a realization regarding Jon Arryn.There is some very enjoyable visceral action as blood flows freely, and individuals receive some nasty comeuppance. (Viewers will love the resolution that takes place in the last few minutes of the episode.) Moreover, the sense of humour is most welcome, as Tyrion \"confesses\" to a series of ridiculous-sounding crimes.The talent in front of and behind the camera make 'Game of Thrones' a rousing brand of entertainment indeed.Eight out of 10.",

While the first half of the episode may be mostly talk and the struggles of trying to run a kingdom, the second half is spectacular on the action/drama front as we witness a sword duel and a brotherly hissy fit. The ending is fantastic, so hold on to your seats.In this episode, \"The Golden Crown,\" Ned reunites with King Robert as Robert leaves him in charge of the kingdom while he is off boar-hunting. Ned also sends Arya and Sansa back to Winterfell and in the process of doing so, he learns of a secret from John Arryn. Meanwhile, Tyrion requests a sword duel to seal his fate and Viserys is losing his patience with Drogo, whom Drogo has a surprise for.Overall, I this another solid entry in this entertaining first season of the hit fantasy series. The ending is just worth watching this episode for. Also, in part due to Drogo's customs, there are quite a few bloody scenes. So for those who have squeamish stomachs, you may want to not eat anything before watching this episode.My Grade: A",

What we do get is we get another good scene with Robb Stark (Richard Madden) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen). And we finally see what Robb can do in combat. We also get to see Arya with her \"dancing master\" Syrio Forel again and she learns a valuable lesson. Maisie Williams and Miltos Yerolemou are, once again, fabulous together. Ser Jorah and Viserys share a good scene too and Viserys comes across, for just a moment, as sympathetic. Just for a moment. And we see Ned make a shocking discovery.My favourite scene of the season so far was Tyrions confession, who didn't want to know the end to Tyrion's story about taking a mule and a honeycomb into a brothel?? Tyrion played to perfection by Peter Dinklage and Arya played by Maisie Williams and dare I say it, noble Ned Stark played by Sean Bean (who I stated in an earlier review, I'm not a fan of him or any of his work) are easily my favourite characters so far. I need to give special mention to Jerome Flynn, who's character still does not have a name on the show (but IMDb says is Bronn) who I'm really enjoying too.One scene that puzzled me, was Joffrey's sudden apology to Sansa, 3 episodes after we saw Cersei advising her son to do just that. Why now?? We do get to see just how naive Sansa (Sophie Turner) is. Turner plays the scene very well going from being rude to her Septa Mordane (a superb Susan Brown) to smitten the minute Joffery arrives. All I can think of, is it tied to a scene following shortly where Eddard announced he was sending the girls back to Winterfell, and Sansa's pleas to stay, she may have been happy to leave had Joffery not apologised. There is a nice moment in that scene that is just a look between Sean Bean and Maisie Williams as Sansa says \"I don't want someone brave, handsome and strong... I want Joffery\" it really showed the chemistry between the two. Possibly the best episode so far!",

A really good scene between the three culminates in Robert demanding Ned continues as Hand of the King and takes care of matters while he goes on a hunt to 'clear his mind'. The drama is intense with Ned and Cersei at loggerheads, a wounded Ned making a big decision to clash with Tywin Lannister and his bannerman Gregor (The Mountain) Clegane and Robert's hunt bringing about a serious mishap that throws everything into chaos. Meanwhile Tyrion hilariously confronts Lysa Arryn and demands trial by combat in the Eyrie.Alongside all the Kings Landing events we also have things developing dramatically across the Narrow Sea with Dany, Viserys and Drogo which climaxes with a tremendous final scene that is thrilling and satisfyingly shocking. It features a silly aspect of gold appearing to melt very quickly in a hot cooking pot (which would not happen) but is acted out so thrillingly and has such an amazing visual moment of horror that I have to forgive the little 'mistake' of the too easily melting gold.This all brings a fantastic mixture of excitement, tension, intrigue and thrills with some great humour thrown in. As well as the amusement from Tyrion, we get a lovely funny scene with Sansa and Arya with Ned when Sansa talks of her love for Joffrey.The acting, dialogue and action are all top notch and it all looks a visual treat. There are so many nice scenes of dialogue, including a beautiful scene between Arya and the wonderful Syrio Forel. This aspect is far better in the series than in the books.This is a superb episode. 10/10.",

                    "content": "Grade: A-A Golden Crown is an episode primarily concerned with justice in Westeros. It shouldn't be a surprise by this point that the justice systems contained within this fantastical/medieval realm are different from our own, but it is still shocking how violent it can get.That being said, in King's Landings, things are more civilised... for now, at least. It is most reminiscent of what we currently have in our real world, with numerous people behind the scenes pulling the strings, everyday people being given a more symbolic sense of power, often quite empty in nature, and every now and then, the system gets somebody like Ned Stark, trying to do the best they can to uphold good values within a system that lets less moral people thrive more and more.In The Vale, things are a lot less balanced, and perhaps unfortunately for those directly involved, a whole lot more exciting. Tyrion is not given a fair chance to defend himself initially, with a presumption of guilt rather than innocence, but is allowed to request a trial by combat. Luckily for him, it works, and once Bronn kills the knight appointed by the other side, Tyrion is allowed to walk off as a free man. Honestly, this sequence is one of the highlights of the season- it's a scrappy, awkward, but still very engaging one-on-one fight, and the visual of the other guy getting pushed out of the moon door is a pretty cool one.Then we get to the Dothraki, and their sense of justice is even more out there and brutal. Viserys believes himself to have the upper hand, staging something of a one-man coup within a sacred site, where the Dothraki are not permitted to shed any blood. Khal Drogo, however, taking a zero-tolerance approach to Viserys threatening his new bride, finds a way to brutally and violently execute Viserys for his crimes without shedding blood in a literal sense, pouring some boiling, liquid metal over his head. The metallic thud his head makes, after the metal solidifies and burns him to death, will probably never leave my mind. Viserys made for a very good villain, but with so many other characters, there was certainly an opportunity here to kill him off in a satisfying yet surprising fashion here. No one expected Viserys to ever end up on the throne, but I don't think many people expected him to last just over half a season. It's a warning to villainous characters that they're just as expendable within this world, and that death does not discriminate.This is another very strong episode that builds things up more, pushes everything forward, and provides a couple of very memorable moments that really help define the season, and the show going forward. As is usually the case for an episode in season 1: it's absolutely fantastic stuff.",

There is plenty of dialogue to digest, but there are some cool action scenes and some rather squeamish imagery, in part, due to the customs of the Dothraki. If I were you, I would advise against eating anything before watching this episode, especially if you cannot stand the sight of blood. This episode is also quite humorous thanks to the lovely quips from Tyrion.The main focus here is across the Narrow Sea with Khal Drogo and Daenerys. It is amazing to see how quickly Daenerys goes from sobbing little girl to steely queen. I guess that little girl wouldn't have the heart to eat a horse's heart, a delightfully gross sequence. Of course, Viserys is the snobbish kingly wannabe and in his next confrontation with his sister, it proves to be his last as Viserys meets his doom by molten gold being poured on him. Definitely a clever plan by Khal Drogo!As we head back to the Eyrie where Tyrion is being kept prisoner, maybe Catelyn acted a little too rash in her kidnapping of the youngest Lannister sibling. Regardless, Peter Dinklage stole the show with his humor. His interaction with the guard, Mort was fun, but the best part is when he \"confessed his crime.\" His stories about his brothel adventures is nothing short of hilarious, and I loved the reaction of Lysa's son, Robin. He also enlists Bronn to fight for his freedom, and we see how scary the Eyrie's moon door can be.Back in King's Landing, King Robert forgives Ned (who survived the fight with Jaime), much to Cersei's displeasure. As Robert is about to go hunting, he gives the throne to Ned. Ned uses his fatherly instincts to protect his daughters and sends them back to King Landing. The bratty Sansa doesn't want to go because she \"wants to make blond babies with Joffrey.\" Arya also has some good moments with Silvio.Back in Winterfell, there are some great brotherly scenes between Robb, Bran, and Theon. We see how great Robb handles the sword and we learn about Bran's vision of the three-eyed raven.This was another great episode, and this episode should end the world-building and the character development for now because I have a feeling that crazy things are going to happen in droves as we send the first season! Fantastic acting is found aplenty, thanks to the likes of Sean Bean, and especially Peter Dinklage. There is some really awesome and somethings disgusting things to behold but prepare to be laughing thanks to Tyrion's hijinks.My Grade: A",

The interactions from the characters are great including Ned Stark and the King and the trial sequence is really interesting. Even the story arc for the Lannister family shines and the interactions between them (and sorry for forgetting to mention that name) are also interesting. My only quibble is that it did drag a bit long.Still, the acting's still great with the performances continuing to shine, the scenery remains gorgeous, the script is smart, the story is good, the dialog is fresh, and the music score continues to have an atmosphere. So, overall, another great episode. Thumbs up! :)",

                    "content": "The previous installment Stark versus Lannister driven story was thrilling but it had a drawback. Indeed it revealed one flaw of the show, its editing. I just found the numerous switches between arcs a little annoying because the transitions weren't smooth enough. Compared to Lost's season 6 for example it lacked some creativity, original ideas to link them instead of sharp cuts. I love Arya and her dancing session in Lord Snow was fantastic but here it felt slightly misplaced or at least not well staged. It's probably the issue when dealing with so many parallel stories, they just can't be all properly covered in one single episode. In my opinion their mistake was to even tell the anecdotic ones like the prostitute flying away or the king hunting. Of course their purpose was to feed the more important ones but I can't help thinking that they should have better arranged them. Or maybe I was just disappointed that it wasn't a special Daenerys installment. I mean she's such a fascinating and ambivalent character ! The Queen of Dothraki literally stole the screen and her few scenes were both shocking and intriguing. One reference that stroke my mind ? Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom ! Yes because Lady Stark, her strange sister and the dwarf were back too. The dungeon is apparently full of surprises and as a roleplayer I'm already dreaming of giant dragons and wicked pitfalls ! If only the show's format was more elegant, like in Fringe's season 3 for instance. Still it didn't change the fact that most story arcs, because I was a bit disappointed by Ned's one, were excellent. As for the ending it confirmed again that Game of Thrones is not for the faint of heart. Long live the King !",

                    "content": "The previous episode was awesome and so my expectations in this \"A Golden Crown\" were pretty high. As it turns out, it totally manages to hold up the pace of its predecessor and contains a couple of important things happening. I was extremely looking forward to see how things will be after Ned's and Jaime's fight and it already began in a superb way when Ned awoke with a furious Cersei and a King Robert who has finally calmed down after his uproar in \"The Wolf and the Lion\" standing in his room. The episode didn't get any worse after that, but I'd say it was already one of the best moments.The continuation of the storyline of Catelyn and Tyrion proved to be hilarious with once again, a marvelous monologue by Peter Dinklage and great performances by all other actors involved. The sword fighting in this episode was too really well-made and the fight scene in which we first meet Bronn was incredibly cool.Ned's discovery in this episode was great as well and really blew my mind because I'm completely unaware of the plot of this series. Sean Bean continually improves in his role and is amazing when he gets to be the regent while reminding the audience that he is clearly the most likable character on this show. It was also really nice to see Isaac Hempstead Wright doing something again and I think it's really interesting how Theon Greyjoy gets more and more important.Clearly the best part about \"A Golden Crown\" is the story part of Viserys, Daenerys, and the Dothrakis who return to the screen after their short absence in the previous episode. There are some major things happening with those characters and we really get to see how the characters progress - all of this is staged perfectly and has a really dark and captivating look to it since all of their scenes are set indoors. The final scene of this episode may just be the best Game of Thrones moment yet and I was so freaked out because of how fantastic this was. I'm completely intrigued in the plot (except for the one at the Night's Watch. Seriously, I didn't miss Jon Snow and all his colleagues at all in this and the last episode - I almost forgot that those characters existed when I was watching these two awesome episodes) and technically, it's extremely well-made. But I can't help myself but to think that Game of Thrones still has a tad more potential to it than it shows us at the moment with supernatural stuff and really big fight scenes still stashed away from the audiences. I'm hoping that the season finale will provide me with the scenes I expect and for now I just stay with loving all the amazing characters and visuals.",

Robb had a discussion with Theon and he says to him that he is not from this house. After Bran is cornered by some thieves. Robb comes to his saving taking off one of them. But then his brother is taking hostage to which Theon kills him and not a single thanks from Robb. And where is everyone else? Shouldn't they be more guarded? Daenerys eats a heart and names his son Rhoan in honor to his uncle. Tyrion asks for an opportunity to confess his \"crimes\" to which he don't talk about trying to kill Bran, of course, he didn't do it. Instead he asks for a fight trial. And ask for someone to fight for him. Bronn fights for him and kill the man unhonorably. I knew he couldn't fight like he said so I suppose this should be what a man in his position should probably do. And yet asking for someone to him is asking for lady luck message because he can't know if the fighter will be capable or would sacrifice himself so he die. There should be other way, unless he had some sort of agreement with Bronn beforehand. Joffrey ask for forgivness to Sansa, she says that she doesn't need to apologize he for nothing and then he says that he will never be cruel or disrespect her again. And like a Disney movie they kiss. Except this is not a Disney world. Sansa is inside a fairy tale delusion and she might be used by the Lannister for their own benefit. And she will be caught in the cross fire. Eddard sees some old book about the Baratheon house lineage and all of them have black hair but Joffrey. And yet the data is too small and the mother genes are important too. So I get what they tried to do here and as such I will let it pass. Viserys has gone mad and now threats Daenerys unborn child to get a crown and so Khal accepts but is a crown made with fire. And so he dies at contact. And no real Dragon can die from fire. So he was not a Dragon. Daenerys is the real Dragon.",

Hopefully these winter people actually know how to run shiz, because I'll be surprised if they don't take things over with next to no effort. That is if they can get past Jon Snow. Or at least the Targaryans will. Speaking, OH SEVEN HELLS YEAH WE'RE GETTING SOME DRAGONS! Bran finally makes Robb prove his worth. Targaryen is becoming pretty hardcore. If you ask me, if she can tame Drogo she can train a dragon. Her brother realizes he's screwed, but is also pretty hopeless. I'll add him to the list of people I won't feel bad about if they die, along with all of the Lannister's except Tyrion, who can talk his way out of anything. Probably even death by dragon.And what is it with all these young princes being obnoxiously psychotic? Maybe because the kings are crazy drunkards. Another reason Jon Snow should be the rightful king. If this were made by Disney he would probably be king by now. Although, Stark has some good potential, and is spitting some hot fire against the Lannister's.Nice to see Drogo do something hard-core. Really hoping for a Drogo vs the The Mountain showdown.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.'Game of Thrones' first season continues to keep going from strength to strength. There is not a bad episode for me in the first season and, while not quite one of the season's very best episodes like \"Winter is Coming\" and the previous two episodes, \"You Win Or You Die\" doesn't disappoint. The overlong, repetitive and gratuitous expositional sex/prostitute scene with Littlefinger is the one drawback to a wonderful episode.\"You Win or You Die\" has many scenes that work very well indeed. The final showdown with the Lannisters, the confrontation between Ned and Cersei, Drogo's rant regarding his son and the Iron Throne and Ned's moral dilemma between stubbornness and honourable intentions are particularly good, and Robert's final scene is very movingly written and acted. It was good to see the villainous characters given the spotlight, as it was to see the Dothraki at their most interesting and Khal Drogo emerging as an interesting character.Visually, \"You Win or You Die\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"You Win or You Die\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. As well as being one of the most thematically rich ones of Season 1, the story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout, the acting is hard to find fault. There couldn't have been a more perfect choice for Lord Tywin than Charles Dance, while Sean Bean's dignity, Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau's ability to convey so much of the tension between him and Tywin with few lines, Mark Addy's poignancy, Emilia Clarke's expressive understatement, Jason Momoa's steely-eyed intensity and Aidan Gillen's broodiness also stand out greatly.Overall, with the exception of one scene this is wonderful. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The events in Kings Landing come to yet another head with this episode offering not one but two twists you won't see coming, the last scene in particularly being almost more jaw-dropping than what happens later.

The other is a man, trying to poison the queen of the horse people. The first sets up Ned as a traitor, and the queen responds with a vengeance. The second incites Drogo to cross the water and gain control of the Seven Kingdoms. Before this, he was happy to maintain his own kingdom and stay put on one side of the water. Now he is a force to be reckoned with. More complications. Ned's daughters' lives become more complicated. The one who would be queen is now seen as a traitor's daughter. The little one gets her first taste of blood. The last we see, her \"dancing instructor\" (teacher of swordsmanship) stands with a wooden stump to face a knight with a sword. She rushes away at his advising.. Things are now split wide open, with Ned no longer useful to the monarchy.",

This is an act of kindness he could pay dearly for as when the king returns he is mortally wounded, having been gored by a boar. His final decree is that Ned should rule as regent till his heir becomes of age but it doesn't seem likely that Cersei and Joffrey will honour that 'scrap of paper. The king also tells Ned that he was wrong to order Daenerys' death but it is too late to countermand the order. Across the Narrow Sea the would-be assassin offers Daenerys wine from a cask fit for somebody of her standing; Jorah Mormont sees through the man and saves Daenerys. When Khal Drogo learns of the plot to kill his wife he swears that he will take his army across the Narrow Sea and put her on the Iron Throne. Meanwhile on the wall it is time for Jon Snow and the other recruits to take their vows and become members of the Night's Watch; he anticipates that he will become a ranger, patrolling north of the wall but is disappointed when he learns that he is to be a steward; a mere servant to a senior officer in his eyes.After the action of the previous episode some may consider this episode a little quiet; that it may be but it does serve to raise the tension as the political dynamics change. King Robert's demise puts Ned in the most perilous position he has been; his enemy's now rule King's Landing and he and his daughters are in grave danger. The fact that he told the queen what he'd learnt about Joffrey may have been a mistake but it served to show that Ned isn't without compassion even when dealing with his enemies. The events on the wall weren't exciting but it was good to see Jon Snow taking his vows but not becoming a ranger; having him get what he wanted would have been a bit clich\u00e9. Of interest this episode introduces us to the much mentioned Tywin Lannister; patriarch of the house. We first see him skinning a stag as he addresses his son Jaime; Charles Dance does a great job in this small scene; I'm sure he will impress even more as we get to know his characters. Overall this was another solid episode with a twist in the final scene.",

However, Ned, being a compassionate man, unwisely shares the information that he's learned (the truth about Joffrey's parentage) with Cersei. This leads to dire consequences. Meanwhile, Jon finally goes through Nights' Watch training, but is assigned to be a steward, rather than a ranger; he's not happy about the idea of being a glorified servant. And, although Robert changes his mind and asks that Daenerys be spared, the ball has already started rolling, and a wine merchant attempts to poison Daenerys. Furious, Khal Drogo vows to attack the Seven Kingdoms.As usual, exemplary acting goes a long way towards selling these characters and immersing us in this environment. 'You Win or You Die' is more about dialogue and situation than action, but when the writing and acting are this good, there are no complaints on that front. In particular, veteran actor Charles Dance has a GREAT cameo at the outset of the episode, bringing to life the man Tywin Lannister, who had been referenced but not seen until this point. Tywin gives Jaime a riveting lecture while skinning a stag. As Robert, Mark Addy has an excellent scene while the King lies on his deathbed. The closing minutes of the episode are fantastic as an ugly confrontation comes to a head, and Jon & Samwell and others get a nasty surprise when a faithful canine wanders off and returns with something in its mouth. Khal Drogos' big speech to his followers crackles with ferocity.With three episodes left to go in this first season, it's commendable how cast & crew have you eager to learn how this will all eventually play out.Eight out of 10.",

The stakes are higher, the feelings are more emotional, and now we have Kings Landing in danger from an enemy across the seas. Also, stay tuned for a great ending. It's an ending that you may or may not have seen coming.In this episode, \"You Win or You Die,\" King Robert is back from the boar hunt, but he lays dying after a grave injury. Ned Stark confronts Cersei and tells her who her son really is. Jon Snow makes his Night Watch vows, despite feeling unhappy for his new role as steward and the disappearance of his Uncle Benji.

With the different locations, all with very different visuals and different feel this adds so much rich quality to the viewing experience.At the wall Jon is faced with his Uncle Benjen's horse returning without him making Benjen's survival even more in doubt. Jon also learns he is not going to be made a Ranger but be appointed as steward to Lord Mormont. He also is aware of dangers facing his family in the South. Amongst this he has to decide to make his vows and become a sworn brother of the Night's Watch. Most people would probably, logically ride back to Winterfell but the honorable, dutiful Jon with his doubts about his place in the world makes the choice to take his vows. A key decision that will be called into question very quickly. All the acting of Kit Harington, James Cosmo, Peter Vaughan, Owen Teale and John Bradley is great providing depth to Jon, Mormont, Maester Aemon, Alliser Thorne and Samwell Tarly delivering dialogue and expressions that make every scene work perfectly.An attempt is made on Dany's life which causes Drogo to make a powerful move towards war. This exciting development brings a great piece of dialogue from the book to life brilliantly. The speech from Drogo is magnificently delivered by Jason Momoa. Emilia Clarke and Iain Glen continue to act with grace and subtlety as Dany and Jorah.Tywin Lannister makes his entrance as a character in a brilliant scene with his son Jaime. Charles Dance is simply perfect as Tywin and immediately imbues the character with such class and power that is magical to watch. Nikolai Coster-Waldau ad Jaime plays his part brilliantly too showing some background to Jaime's motivations and inner conflict.King Robert (Mark Addy) sustains a serious injury on a hunt throwing the political struggles in King's Landing into a drastic situation requiring pivotal decisions. Ned (Sean Bean) has a great scene with Cersei (Lena Headey), again wonderfully brought to life from the book, where he warns her of his intentions. His honour overriding any clever manouvres. With Robert's injury Ned is named Lord Protector but must face the calculating Cersei and vile Joffrey, impressively played by Jack Gleeson. All the acting of these scenes is amazing and the scene in the throne room with Ned hoping to gain support from Ser Barristan, Littlefinger and the City watch against Cersei, Joffrey and the Kingsguard. Electrifying and hugely dramatic.This is a truly great episode which sets the series alight and starts to make a claim to be one of the finest (possibly the finest) shows of the last 30 years. 10/10.",

Perhaps it shouldn't have been surprising then that King Robert only lasted seven episodes- with a reasonably well-established king on the throne (granted, the Targaryen's might not like that statement, but most other families seemed somewhat okay with a Baratheon ruler), the 'game' would be less exciting. With a contested throne, and many houses that would like to have their leaders sit upon it, an unexpected (but perhaps planned) demise of the former king is just what Westeros needed to fully unravel into chaos.This is absolutely the best episode of the show so far- a near perfect hour of television that provides fantastic scene after fantastic scene, and then suggesting by the episode's end that things will only escalate even more (somehow). It is such a great episode that you don't even notice the absence of two of the best characters so far: Tyrion and Arya.Right off the gate, Tyrin Lannister's introduction is amazing. We get a great sense of who he is, what his values are, and what he wants for his family, and the way he says everything so precisely whilst not skipping a single beat, when it comes to skinning that deer... it's chilling but very compelling stuff. Tywin is absolutely one of the show's best characters; despite his ruthlessness and intensity, his motives are often understandable, and despite his imposing nature, he is not as unlikable as some of the other Lannisters, although that may just be me. Probably helps that Charles Dance is one of the best actors the show ever employed.Ned Stark darting around King's Landing is great too, as is his final scene with Robert Baratheon. We understand why he does what he does in this episode, when he does it, but it is frustrating seeing his honour being something that ends up getting him into so much trouble. The last scene is a truly shocking moment, where you'll be both excited and nervous to see what comes next. And if you don't hate the characters of Joffrey and Cersei by this point (somehow), then you certainly will after this climactic scene.Drogo's declaration to invade Westeros is fantastic too: scary, intense, and also extremely satisfying. I'm impressed by Jason Momoa's ability to deliver dialogue in a fictional language with such passion, and while most wouldn't call him an amazing actor most of the time, this might be one of his very best scenes in the entire show.There is also a particularly graphic scene in here that I'm surprised they could show on television: even HBO. I don't want to mark down the episode for it, but I could see some people being bothered by how far it goes, and how long it goes on for. But I suppose it shouldn't be too surprising, considering what has come before.Overall, this is a season highlight- maybe even a highlight of the entire series. The Game of Thrones truly starts here, and Westeros will never be the same again...",

With two episodes left, there is plenty of political turmoil with the land of Westeros at the brink of a civil war. There is, of course, threat of invasion from the Dothraki-given the events that occurred in this episode. This fast-paced episode has it all. Action, betrayal, character development, humor, and even the death of a popular character. The acting remains as great as usual, although this episode does lack the charm of both Tyrion and Arya-two of my favorite characters. Still, you are in for a treat with this magnificent episode.King Robert is gravely injured on his boar hunt, as he recklessly charged a boar. He will not live much longer given the extent of his injuries. On this deathbed, he names Ned Lord Regent of the Seven Kingdoms until his son, Joffrey comes of age. Cersei, turning into the series true villain, objects to this move. All she has to do is wait until Robert dies so she can put Joffrey on the throne now. Sick family! Maybe it has to do with the fact that Ned wants Robert's brother, Stannis to take the throne. But still...After much building up, we finally meet the head of the Lannister household, Tywin Lannister. Charles Dance has a knack of playing mean old guys, but this mean old guy right here may be the best of them all. The shame he interjects in Jaime as he is skinning and mashing up a deer carcass tells you the kind of character he is. Sly and cunning, we see where Cersei gets her skills to manipulate from. With Jaime struggling with his public image, Tywin sends him to rescue Tyrion.Over on the Night Watch, they all take their vows. Jon Snow is upset when he was not chosen as a ranger. Instead, he is given the position of Lord Mormont's steward. Doing his usually sulking around, he gets advice from Sam to cheer up and everything happens for a reason. Great acting in this section, but this was my least favorite part of the episode (still incredibly interesting and well-done).Across the Narrow Sea, King Robert sent a wine salesman to poison Daenerys. Thanks to the quick action by double agent, Ser Jorah (now we know his allegiance), she lives. This angers Khal Drogo and he promises to invade Westeros. The way the wine salesman life has ended, well.....let's just say it was quite painful.Overall, this was a fantastic episode that really starts putting all the pieces together. The episode ends in the ultimate betrayal thanks to the scheming of Littlefinger. Are we really surprised? I feel bad for Ned, but a scapegoat is needed somewhere for the Lannisters. I also feel bad for his daughters. Speaking of Littlefinger, Baelish had some great dialogue in a scene where he shows two prostitutes (including the main one from Winterfell, Roz) how to do their job, while crooning over his lost love for Catelyn. Classic! Anyhow, things are just starting to get crazy. Stay tuned!My Grade: A",

Kudos to the writers for creating that scene so great.The story is still good, the rest of the performances are still great, the script is terrific, the pacing, while a bit slower, is still fine, and the music score is still great and suited the scene between Cersei and Ned really well with a sense of eerie and subtlety.

Tolkien set his fantasy writings in Middle-earth. Smoking dragons wouldn't be able to burn villages if they weren't able to fly. That's for the air. Is there a common ground for all these families ? And what if the Gods were only toying their creation from deep down the sea ? Atlantis, Greek and Norse mythologies\u0085 The perfect number for the most pivotal episode so far. Se7en wicked steps to lose it and feel alive : 1. Digest the recap to freshen up your dry memory and dive in the most wonderful opening of all title sequences. 2. Chop up an animal corpse from beginning to end in front of the camera and give a visceral lecture on family values to Jaime Lannister. 3. Let the Littlefinger talk while teaching an exotic prostitute how to please the curvy nature of a Caucasian beauty. 4. Alert Jon Snow, hint at a possible beginning of the end and unveil an intriguing destiny. Bonus : Dungeons & Dragons joke. 5. Forge A Golden Crown for Daenerys dear brother then melt Ned's fate in the most unpredictable shapes. 6. Learn Dothraki to make sure you understand what Khal Drogo says because Jason Momoa's performance was both gentle and furious ! The 7th is obvious, it's yours.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.'Game of Thrones' first season continues to keep going from strength to strength. There is not a bad episode in the season and to me \"The Pointy End\" is one of its best. Not sure about it being THE best though, for such a lot going on and being so rich in story and character occasionally it was a little too busy and could have had more time to breathe. A couple of the side characters are given short shrift somewhat too. Otherwise, \"The Pointy End\" is a wonderful episode.Already great characters like Tyrion and Arya are given plenty to do and have all of what makes them such good characters in the first place. Seeing Robb get the spotlight and mature was also a great strength, and any episode that makes Sansa interesting and sympathetic is deserving of a medal. The ending is a nail-biter and makes one want to see how the season ends, Syrio Forel's confrontation with the Lannisters is another highlight. Author George R. R. Martin's involvement is a large part to \"The Ponty End's\" success, before this episode he hadn't written a teleplay in a decade but he writes as if this big gap didn't happen.Visually, \"The Pointy End\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Pointy End\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. As well as being one of the most thematically rich ones of Season 1, the story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Helped by the superb character and multi-layered writing throughout (some of the richest of Season 1 in fact), the acting is hard to find fault. Peter Dinklage, Sophie Turner and Richard Madden are particularly strong, Dinklage has always been a high-point of 'Game of Thrones' while the other two really allow their respective characters to grow.In short, an on point episode with almost everything executed wonderfully. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

These people are being laughed at and that may come back to bite him in the butt. Ned Stark rots in the dungeon while his daughter is being used as a pawn. She is naive and inexperienced, but she has the courage to ask the boy king for mercy for her father. Meanwhile, Tyrion is back in the presence of his father. Of course, there is no love for him other than his being a blood relative and demanding respect. He is by far the most intriguing of characters, many dimensional, devious and self centered, and as slippery as one can be. But, the big deal now is that all the forces are in place, and their collision will make up the last two episodes of the first season.",

They try to capture Arya, but Syrio Forel defends her and she escapes but finds her sword Needle and beings with her. When a boy tries to grab her, she accidentally kills him. Varys visits Ned in the dungeon and gives water to him and updates him with the news. Sansa agrees to send a letter to Robb to protect her father. Jon is frustrated that he cannot join his brother in the imminent war. He saves Commander Mormont during the night when a monster tries to kill him. Tyrion and Bronn are under siege of hill tribes and the cunning dwarf negotiates with them and they travel together to the place where the Lannister army is camped. Khal Drogo and his warriors destroy a village to take people to sell as slave to finance his invasion of the Seven Kingdoms. Daenerys orders to stop killing and raping the villagers and one of the Drogo's men offends Daenerys and challenges Drogo to fight with him. Drogo is wounded on his chest and one of the women she saved that is a witch treats his wound. Robb has a meeting with the lords and consolidates his leadership. When his men capture a Lannister scout, Robb releases him and sends a message to Lord Tywin telling that he will fight against him. Tyrion meets his father with the hill tribes that join their army. Sansa begs to her father's life in the court and Joffrey says that he will not kill Ned if he confesses his treason and recognizes him as king. \"The Pointy End\" is a great episode with many plot points. Varys is a despicable eunuch, serving the realm in order to be always with The Powers That Be. At the Wall, the dead raises when they are touched by the Night Walker. The strategy of Robb releasing the Lannister scout is certainly to lure Tywin. What will happen to Drogo? Ned will certainly not confess treason and how will he be saved? My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"The Pointy End\"",

All those who support the Starks in King's Landing are quickly slain, his daughter Arya must flee for her life while Sansa's position suddenly changes; she is told that she can no longer expect to marry her beloved Joffrey and begs for mercy for her father. When news of these events reaches Winterfell Robb Stark summons his bannermen and prepares to wage war against the Lannisters.Meanwhile on the Wall rangers return with the bodies of two men who went missing some time ago; Sam notes that they don't smell rotten as one might expect\u0085 and later we learn why; they have become White Walkers. When they attack they aren't harmed by swords; only fire kills them.Freed from the Eyrie, Tyrion and his companion Bronn, meet some members of the hill tribes; luckily for them even these barbarians can be bought with Lannister gold and they take Tyrion back to his father. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys shows mercy to the women of a tribe the Dothraki have just defeated and plan to have their way with\u0085 denying them their 'reward' may have lost her some of her support although Khal Drogo stands up to his men to protect her.This was another fine episode that continues to set things up for the war between the Starks and the Lannisters which has now become inevitable. It is hard to see how Ned will survive and Arya's safety is very much in doubt\u0085 for the first time she is forced to use her 'Needle' on a person. The opening scenes are fairly bloody and we see a few established characters die. The saddest of these is Arya's tutor, Syrio Forel, his actual death is off screen but before he falls he defeats several knights using only a wooden sword! Miltos Yerolemou was great in this roll; I'll miss his scenes with Maisie Williams' Arya. It was great to see Peter Dinklage giving another entertaining performance as Tyrion; his speech explaining how he hopes to die was hilarious. After several episodes where Daenerys' status among the Dothraki improved it was interesting to see her compassion set that status back somewhat; it will be interesting to see how it affects her in later episodes. Here we see it lead to one the Dothraki challenging Khal Drogo which leads to an impressive fight. The events at the wall were interesting as they showed us more of the White Walkers; a threat that will inevitable play an important part of the story at some point. Overall a fine episode that advanced the plot nicely and contained many great scenes.",

Ned's daughter Sansa is determined to plead his case, despite still feeling love for the new king Joffrey. And Tyrion & Bronn make for an amusing team, soon acquiring other companions whom Tyrion must mollify with promises of rewards.'The Pointy End' is great, bloody fun, sparked by the typically zesty acting that viewers come to expect from the series. Peter Dinklage continues to supply much of the comedy touches, coming up with an especially witty reply when asked how he would like to die. Guest star Charles Dance has a marvellous presence as Tywin, and there are some memorable moments for Jason Momoa as Khal Drogo; he is shown in combat, and proves to have no mercy when dealing with a challenger. Daenerys again shows a great deal of compassion, which could potentially be her undoing if she weren't Drogo's partner. Jon shows himself to be quite capable in a fight when he dispatches that aforementioned humanoid.As this viewer nears the end of the first season, he's definitely intrigued to see how far the writers will go, and what manner of confrontations they will devise.This was the first episode to be scripted by author George R.R. Martin himself.Eight out of 10.",

This episode is all about the Lannisters asserting their power over the Starks, and it is very interesting to watch. I particularly liked the addition of Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister. It's clear he hates his youngest son, but their conversations are very clever and engaging. Also, Richard Madden stands out in this episode as Robb Stark. He finally gets to be front and center, and he does it quite well.In this episode, \"The Pointy End,\" Ned is betrayed by the Lannisters and is set to rot away in a cell. Joffrey who now claims the title of king commands Robb Stark to commit fealty towards him. He agrees to come to Kings Landing, but this time with an army. The Night's Watch realizes that the White Walkers have returned. Finally, a disagreement ensues between Khal Drogo and one of his men over the issue of slavery.Overall, this is a great episode. It may not be the greatest episode to date, but it sure packs a punch. I thought the Night's Watch scenes could be tidied up a little bit more, but other than that this is a very fine episode.My Grade: A",

Robb learns of his father's arrest and makes a decision from which there will be no turning back. My favourite scene of the season so far is in this episode, (Tyrions confession previously held it, with Arya's first 'dancing class before it) and it is one of the first, a pivotal moment featuring Arya and Syrio. Sansa's also has a significant role to play in this episode, Sophie Turner really shines in her scenes. Tyrion is back, and again he gets the best lines (when asked how he wants to die, his reply his hilarious) and he is forming a great double act with Bronn. We see Jon Snow and Khal Drogo in combat and both impress. Though Daenerys compassion (her \"gentle heart\" as Ser Jorah calls it) could cause her problems, but with Drogo by her side nobody will dare cross her. For my money this is the best episode to date.",

                    "content": "After the momentous events of the previous episode this deals with the aftermath and how things continue to develop. It maintains the absorbing drama and the involving character journeys. The episode is written by GRR Martin, the author of the book series the show is based on.There is a fittingly beautiful scene with Syrio Forel and Arya, faced with Lannister men coming to take Arya, maintaining the quality of all of their brilliant training scenes. Syrio is a made into a gem of a character by actor Miltos Yerolemou and the direction and writing of all the scenes they had together and these scenes hold an important place in establishing Arya's character. GRR Martin adapts the scene from his own original story version. Interestingly the earlier scenes with Syrio in previous episodes were better than the book version which has more of Arya reflecting on her training and less scenes of them actually interacting together. This scene is fairly close to the one in the book but has a rather different fight scene. After establishing Syrio as a touchingly magical guest character this scene is very moving.We also have moving scenes of Sansa facing the Lannister attack and being brought before the Queen in a couple of scenes with the manipulative Cersei as vile as usual.Ned is visited by Varys in a very nice scene and Joffrey continues to be fantastically slimy and cocky. Arya faces a further important moment as a stable boy catches her escaping. I do not think Maisie Williams gets enough credit for her superb job acting the part so well from such a young age.Meanwhile Jon and Mormont face a dead body rising to attack which gives them the clue that the White Walkers are back. This scene is suitably exciting in between the excitement and tense happenings in King's Landing.From the cold white North we are transported to the searing heat of Essos and the vibrant scenes with Dany naively trying to save women from Dothraki rapers which leads to a battle between Drogo and one of his men. This is done differently to the book but has a similar outcome with Dany allowing a captured healer to treat Drogo's wound.We have excellent scenes of Tyrion meeting up with his father Tywin which well establish the disdain with which Tyrion is treated as well as providing some good amusement.We also have Robb starting to make his move to war and some good scenes with Bran, with the Greatjon and with Catelyn.GRR Martin writing this episode is a nice touch and it continues the fabulous standards of the series.",

                    "content": "Grade: B-This episode suffers, somewhat unsurprisingly, from being sandwiched in between the two best episodes of the season. Granted, it's still very good, but there are a few issues here and there with this episode that I don't feel the other parts of this season suffer from. It is vital and necessary for the overall show, and contains the satisfying moments you'd hope for and expect from an episode within the second half of a Game of Thrones season, but I don't hesitate to call it the closest thing to a weak point within the show's excellent first season.First off, the lack of Ned- after getting betrayed and imprisoned at the end of the last episode- does hurt this episode a little, given what a great character he is, but it's ultimately an incredibly small complaint. Less easy to forgive is some slightly iffy acting from the two Stark girls, who otherwise are generally quite good.Then there's the whole matter of some things feeling very rushed within this episode, which feels strange, given how the rest of the season feels perfectly paced. The odd warrior characters Tyrion meets come out of nowhere quite jarringly, and while their presence works better in the book, where they're more fleshed out, here their inclusion feels a bit off. If I had to guess, I'd say Martin fought to keep them in the show, because the show runners were otherwise excellent at knowing what to keep and what to scrap from the books, in these early seasons (of course, their skill at keeping the story going after the show overtook the books is much more heavily debated).And while it's great to see a large-scale war kick off between the Starks and the Lannisters, and while the conflict has been building throughout the season, to see it approach all out combat within this episode feels jarring. It just feels like it happens a little too quickly, and maybe even just one or two more episodes being in between the betrayal of Ned and the armies preparing for war would have made things feel more natural; otherwise, maybe a more clear indication of a jump ahead in time could have helped?Still, like I said, it's ultimately still good TV. There's more excellent Tywin stuff, with Charlies Dance killing it as always. Dany and Drogo's storyline is pretty exciting in this episode too, and the start of the episode is certainly strong, with the intense and horrifying depiction of the aftermath of the Lannister betrayal against the Starks, as well as Syrio's emotional sacrifice to save Arya's life. And of course, some of the best and most memorable Game of Thrones episodes are right around the corner, so while this episode is more flawed than the ones that came before it, it does serve as a necessary stepping stone to get to the season's excellent final two episodes.",

                    "content": "\"The Pointy End\" is another astonishing episode of Game of Thrones. There are many plot points to digest, but they are important to the final two episodes to close out the season. This episode was penned by no other than the GOT expert himself, George R.R. Martin. This was his first screenplay he wrote in over 15 years, and he certainly did a great job moving pieces around and getting everything in place. Great acting dominates the scene as usual. It's nice to have Peter Dinklage back as he was sorely missed last episode. His interactions with his father and while in danger with some hill tribes are fantastic! At least we learn how he intends to die. At the age of 80, drinking wine and bedding girls. Nice, Tyrion!This episode has the Lannisters asserting their power over the Starks. Ned Stark is rotting away in the dungeons, with the eunuch Varys as his only visitor. As least Varys keeps Ned in the loop and brings him bread and water in the process. It's not much better for the Stark girls. Arya is practicing with Sylvio when the Red Keep comes for her, but Sylvio forces her to run. Sansa is placed under arrest. Her engagement for Joffrey is still on and she still claims she loves him. However, she pleads for the release of his father. Joffrey promises her that he will not be killed if he admits he is the true king, and Cersei forces her to write a letter to her brother Robb to declare fealty of the new king.This episode is the first time we really see Robb in action. Robb gathers a huge army and sits at the head with the goal to attack the Lannisters. Robb sets free a Lannister guard and tells him to go to Tywin to say that they are coming. Catelyn reunites with Robb, but she loses Tyrion in the process.Speaking of which, Tyrion and Bronn escape from her clutches and ends up meeting a hill tribe bent on killing them. Through his sharp words, Tyrion manages to get the hill tribe to fight for the Lannister army. When arriving in Tywin's camp, Tywin looks less than pleased. But he may have a spot for the hill tribe after all.In order to pay for the war against the Seven Kingdoms, Drogo and the rest of the Dothraki plunders and rapes a village while selling their people into slavery. Daenerys wants them to end their practices, and Drogo agrees. But one Dothraki is not happy and challenges Drogo. Drogo ends up wounded, but can a witch work her wonders on Daenerys's husband?Finally, let's go to the North. Jon Snow is still not happy about his job assignment. Something has to make him spring into action, right? Maybe that thing could be.....a zombie! Yup, zombies (known as White Walkers) are \"alive\" and well beyond the wall. In a world without guns, it would be interesting to see how they adapt to killing these zombies. Luckily, Jon was able to save Commander Mormont from a gruesome death.Overall, this is another amazing episode thanks to the screenplay by Martin and the skillful direction of Daniel Minahan. It is somewhat of a talkative episode, but everything moves at a fast pace. No heavy or long monologues. Most of the dialogue is short and straight to the point. And of course, Tyrion adds the humor that we all so desperately love. Also, props must be given to Jack Gleeson. I absolutely loathe his character and wish all the bad luck in the world on him, but he plays his character with gusto and I applaud him for that!My Grade: A",

Also, the end scene where Joffrey promises to show mercy to Ned Stark if he confesses his treason and accept him as the rightful king is very intense. My only quibble is that some of the other side characters weren't given much to do, but it doesn't matter.It's still well-acted, it's still well-written, and the pacing is much tighter this time around. The music score still manages to be beautiful and the direction is really good. So, overall another great episode and a great set up to the last two episodes of Season 1.",

The truth is that this 8th installment was so thrilling that it convinced me that Game of Thrones would make a great video game. Its gallery of personas is so exciting and diverse. Khal Drogo is probably to the show who Goro is to Mortal Kombat ! A baby crazy crab with a pigtail ? Show some respect ! Seriously his fight against one of his men was bloody brutal and I already anticipate how charismatic he'll look in Conan the Barbarian even if I'll never forget Arnold Schwarzenegger fantastic portrayal. Moreover the scene was mesmerized by what was happening on the winter front. The climatic contrast between both regions, like fire and ice, made me feel like if Daenerys was connected to Jon somehow. Is Drogoro the vessel that will allow her to unleash her inner dragon ? And what about the wolf, is it the dark side of the Snow ? It's obvious the writers blur the lines on purpose and I wouldn't be surprised if their bond became so strong that the death of the animal would be fatal to its Shadow Dancer.With a lethal Littlefinger on his throat I really worried for Ned's fate. In fact considering what happened to some other characters I wouldn't have been surprised to see him meet a quick death. They don't show mercy on Game of Thrones and that's definitely refreshing and plain bold ! That's why the scene with Cersei and Barristan was so intense because I was almost sure that they wouldn't hesitate to kill him or even call him a traitor. Ian McElhinney performance was knightly to say the least and I really hope his character will turn his back on them, save Ned and join the Stark to make her reign as short as possible. Yes because no one considers Joffrey rules. He's only a puppet in the hands of her evil mother ! But when their vicious smiles toward Sansa made me angry I have to admit that his attitude after her speech convinced me that there's still hope. Was his love declaration in the previous episode authentic ? I thought it was only an other of their mind games. It leads us to Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. The size of a dwarf but the talent of a giant ! His every lines are delightful of wit and the contexts they're told are just hilarious. In fact Jon Snow's chubby buddy reminds me a little of him because at first they look useless but once they begin to talk you quickly realize they compensate their physical weakness with bright intelligence. It's also the case for Arya and I hope her swordfight lessons will help her survive ! As for her brother Bran praying session it was both poetic and funny. A naked giant in the woods ? Gods in the leaves ? Just mystical !",

                    "content": "Ned is imprisoned and only has about three minutes of screen time in this episode, so you would guess that the show suddenly gets boring, right? Hell no, Robb is Lord Stark now and boy, is he badass in this episode. This is the first time that he really gets to be a major character and he owns absolutely every single scene he's in. We can expect one of them to die in the season finale (maybe both, but I sincerely hope not) and Richard Madden's intriguing performance as Robb managed to make me root more for him than for Ned. Catelyn finally getting together with at least parts of her family was also great to see and the scene with Robb and her was utterly fascinating. And while the Winterfell story part was clearly paramount in 'The Pointy End', most of the other locations were entertaining as well. Despite the huge events at the end of the last episode, King's Landing isn't that much in the fore as I'd expected it to be which is not generally a bad thing because even those scenes dragged a bit from time to time, so I think I would've only been bored with more scenes there. Lena Headey's turn was once again absorbing to watch and Jack Gleeson also gets more and more interesting, but I just feel that his character has way too little screen time to really let the audience get to know him. One crucial moment in this episode was Tyrion encountering his father Tywin for the first time to be seen on the show while having a lot of grubby companions coming with him. Their conversation wasn't as interesting as I'd hoped it to be, mostly because there wasn't anything new being discussed in the scene. In the end, Peter Dinklage proved once again to be a hugely talented actor and Charles Dance also did a very fine job as his evil daddy, the plot just wasn't that juicy.The weakest scenes of this episode were happening at either the Night's Watch or at whatever place the Dothraki scenes are taking place. Unnecessary supporting characters are being introduced again and there are some serious acting problems to be found. Even though George R. R. Martin, the author of the novels that are the basis for the series, wrote this episode, I feel like it isn't exactly how it was meant to be. Some important scenes last for too short, some less important scenes get too much time. I always feel like they don't use all the potential they've got.",

One thing I love that Game of Thrones has done so far is not have any characters be invincible, as a viewer you can feel each life as something that can be taken away at almost any moment. This results in a highly realistic style of storytelling I very much enjoy.I am also now looking forward to seeing the three main stories clash together, not necessarily in a battle (although that is probably what will happen).The hate for some of these characters is continually growing too. Not yet at the point of most hated fictional character but getting somewhat close.Overall I think this is the best episode of Game of Thrones so far, not in visuals, soundtrack, or even story development, but at pure entertainment of the rollercoaster this show has now become.",

And arguably the two most stupid and deceitful characters in the entire show, Joffrey and Cercei, are suddenly running the show. This can only go bad.But beside that, the story takes some interesting twists and you can't help but root for Jon Snow and Samwell Tarly. They are a really cool duo. And there is a little cliffhanger to what exactly happened to Arya Stark, another nice character. Well we'll see. I guess I might get over the lame excuse of a reason that triggered this Lannister/Stark conflict from last episode, but it might take a while. It was so lame and I am stunned no other have pointed it out here.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Of a consistently great first season, \"Baelor\" is a strong contender for the best episode (certainly the best one up to that point) and one of the best episodes of 'Game of Thrones'. It was the most critically acclaimed episode up to this early nine-episode point of the show, and for good reason. As well as being as always superbly made, \"Baelor\" is also an emotional roller-coaster in a way that the previous episodes weren't as much (not that they weren't at all, on the contrary, just not to this extent).\"Baelor\" is one of the show's richest in characterisation, story and themes and executes it in a way that's tightly paced, dramatically concise, never exposition-heavy, never rambling and not feeling too busy or bloated. Pieces of exposition here, like Tyrion's tent scene, are done tastefully and serve a point instead of being padding, giving great and interesting a chance to shine.Visually, \"Baelor\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well. The final shot has a powerful haunting quality.One cannot talk about \"Baelor\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. As well as being one of the most thematically rich ones of Season 1, the story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.The best scene, and the most acclaimed one, is the ballsy conclusion, which is both frightening and heart-wrenching and up there with the greatest and most shocking twists in television. Tyrion's tent scene is entertaining. Alan Taylor provides some of the best direction of the show, adding hugely to the conclusion's impact.All the characters are wonderfully written and layered, Tyrion for good reason is a favourite among fans and critics, while Ned epitomises morally complex nobility and Joffrey is like the devil incarnate in a young body, it is scary at how a character so young could be so evil. The introduction of the Freys is very well handled here. The acting is superb all round, standouts being Sean Bean, Jack Gleeson, Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams and Peter Dinklage.In short, amazing episode that shocked and devastated me. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

One thing that continues to strike me, however, is the absolute ruthlessness of most of the people. Has everyone been disenfranchised? Is everyone living in fear? Ambition seems to be the utter driving force for most; that is understandable. But from his birth, Joffrey has been promised the kingdom. Like Macbeth, he plays most foul for it. His mother watches his machinations, but he is the one character that I despise the most among many. He appears to be a sociopath or a sadist. He kills for pleasure, not for ambition. Meanwhile, his mother sits next to him, barely batting an eye. I'm look forward to what happens between these two. There is no mercy, as we find out with Ned, who is willing to confess to save his daughters but doesn't figure the consequences. The armies are meeting. Snow has received a sword but has vowed to the knights. Khal Drogo has suffered an infection and appears to be dying, and the Missus goes to a sorceress for advice to try to keep him alive.",

Jon Snow receives a valuable sword from Mormont and lives a dilemma to make a choice of helping Robb or stay with the Night's Watch and to live with the consequences for the rest of his life. The infection in the wound of Drogo makes him weak and Daenerys summons the witch to heal him. She tells that a life must be sacrificed in exchange and she kills Drogo's horse. The Lannister army attacks Robb's army and discovers that Robb lured them, leaving only two thousand men behind, while eighteen thousand men have attacked Jaime's army and made him prisoner. Arya sees her father being brought chained in front of the crowd and falsely confessing his treason to save Sansa and Arya. However Joffrey betrays the deal and Ned is beheaded. \"Baelor\" is so far, the best episode of \"Game of Thrones\". I would never expect the fate of Lord Eddard 'Ned' Stark. I do not believe that the witch is making a spell to heal Drogo since he slaughtered her people. My guess is that the life in exchange per Drogo's life will be his unborn child. Joffrey is probably the most despicable character so far. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Baelor\"",

                    "content": "As this episode starts Ned Stark is told that he may yet survive; if he confesses to his treason and affirms that Joffrey is the rightful king he will be allowed to take the black and live out his life on the wall with the Night's Watch. On the Wall we see Jon Snow rewarded for his part in stopping the White Walkers. Elsewhere the Stark's and Lannisters prepare to enter battle at last, but first Catelyn Stark must persuade Lord Walder Frey to let Robb's army cross his bridge; the price she agrees is high\u0085 when the war is over Robb must marry one of his daughters and when she is old enough Arya is promised to his son. In the Lannister camp Tyrion spends what he fears will be his last night with a woman and some interesting truths are revealed. Meanwhile across the Narrow Sea Khal Drogo is taken ill; Daenerys orders the witch to save him even though she says the cost will be high.For most of the episode this is all fairly typical, not that that is a bad thing; we have some gently plot progression, Tyrion bedding Shae, an attractive woman, and some negotiations. Then there is a shift; we see that Daenerys' power is more fragile than we thought; if Drogo dies she will be in immediate danger from his successor. The opening battles between the Starks and the Lannisters go the Stark's way and Jaime Lannister is captured but no soon have seen that than we see the finale when Ned learns that no matter what he says King Joffrey will not spare him\u0085 this is the most shocking scene of the series so far; Sean Bean has done a great job as Ned Stark and everything we've seen so far leads us to believe that he is the main character; surely he can't die in the first season? If he can be killed off none of the main characters can be considered safe.In the run up to this shocking finale we get plenty of great scenes; the best ones involve Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister. First we get a touching scene where he ends up telling Shae and Bronn about his first love then an hilarious moment when he is accidentally rendered unconscious by one of his own men on the way to the battle! This meant the makers could save some money as we see the aftermath of the battle from his point of view as he wakes up rather than actually seeing a battle. The scenes involving Daenerys were also interesting and the fact that there was no resolution there means viewers will be keen to see what happens next! Overall one of the best episodes yet; I am looking forward to seeing season one's conclusion.",

Jon learns of his brother Robb's march, and ponders whether he should be with his sibling or stay where he is. Mormont, grateful to Jon for saving his life, presents him with the gift of a sword. Tyrion reveals an important part of his past when playing a truth-telling / drinking game with Bronn. And Ned, after a pivotal conversation with Varys, ultimately makes a fateful decision.At the time, this was the best episode to date in this shows' first season. It truly pulls out all the stops for the sake of a visceral, emotionally affecting experience. The cast is better than they've ever been, the regular cast members and the guest stars alike. There are some typically nasty shots of violence, and there is also a sense of real foreboding as Daenerys indulges in some sort of black magic in order to save the life of Khal Drogo, who's received a very serious battle wound.All of this culminates in what must have been a truly shocking moment for viewers at the time. Overall, it makes 'Baelor' a grim outing for all concerned, especially when young Arya sees something that would be traumatic viewing for any child. It leaves the shows' audience wondering how much uglier things can get, and how the various characters will react.Powerful stuff.Eight out of 10.",

What bothers me is that Jon Snow never did get that last chat with his father Ned Stark about his real mother and Robb Stark was on his well on his way with his army to help their father. The two Stark daughters witnessed what happened first hand to their father Eddard. My blood boils at this point looking looking at Joffrey - the next few episodes will reveal more. 10/10",

Now up to this point, this has been a very good show that I have come to love, but each episode fell just short of perfection. Now we have finally reached an episode that reaches that elusive mark. I loved nearly every moment of this episode, but the end is the climax. I will say I have never met a character I despised as much as Joffrey, especially for his actions in this episode.In this episode, \"Baelor,\" Sansa begs for mercy so that her father can live. Joffrey agrees, but only on the condition that Ned admits he was a traitor. Ned refuses at first, but then comes to his senses as he realizes the importance of his children. Meanwhile, Arya escapes and lives as a peasant. Robb Stark proves to be an able general and declares war on the Lannisters. Tywin Lannister orders Tyrion to be in the vanguard of the army against the Stark army. Finally, Khal Drogo is seriously sick and Vaenary's reputation is nothing without him.Overall, this is the greatest episode yet of Game of Thrones. There is so much things going on, but it does not distract from the point of the show. There is great acting all around, but this is Sean Bean's time to shine. Did I say how much I hate King Joffrey? The ending is going to provide a great ripple effect, so it will be interesting to see how that happens.My Grade: A+",

And I've gone from wanting to slap him, to wanting to outright kill the little prat.Daenerys has to make a difficult decision, as does honourable Ned Stark. Oh noble Ned and his honour. His so Robb is forced to make some tough decisions of his own too. An old charmer named Walder Frey makes an appearance, and is decidedly sleazy. My favourite scene of the episode for me was a drinking game between Tyrion, Bronn and a prostitute Shae, where he revealed the tale of his doomed first marriage. If this was the year he won the Emmy it is deserved. I have loved watching his performances and he is a firm favourite of mine. But the most memorable part of this episode still has to be the end. I was in a furious shock!! And was straight on the phone to my brother (who has seen them all) going mad!! As I said in previous reviews, I am not a Sean Bean fan, and feel he is the weak link in everything I see him in (Goldeneye, Ronin, LOTR). But I love his Ned Stark, and he is excellent here. All bets are off after this episode.",

                    "content": "The tremendous story threads leading up to this episode reach a climax in a thrilling way.At the wall Jon is rewarded for saving Lord Commander Mormont by being gifted Mormont's family sword Longclaw but he hears of Robb riding to war against the Lannisters and is heartbroken that having just taken his vows he is unable to join his brother without breaking his oath to the Night's Watch. A beautiful scene with Maester Aemon, wonderfully played by veteran actor Peter Vaughan, makes his choice clear to him.In the vibrantly different setting of Essos we find Drogo suffering from his festering wound and Dany is put in an extremely difficult situation. She entrusts Drogo's life and her own wellbeing to the enslaved healer who she already trusted to treat his wound. Dramatic events result from her actions.Robb needs to cross the Trident to ride South and face the Lannisters in war but Catelyn (played with grace and poise by Michelle Fairley) has to negotiate with the vile Walder Frey (fantastically played by David Bradley) to cross the bridge at the Towers. Once across Robb must find a way to outwit the shrewd military might of Tywin Lannister. This is all done to great effect.Peter Dinklage shines as always as Tyrion with scenes of humour and pathos. The revealing of his sad first marriage is done differently to the book but this scene works really well. In the book Tyrion then actually fights in the battle which here is avoided but it is sufficiently well done to gloss over that omission.Another great scene with Varys pleading with Ned to disregard truth in order to make peace with the Lannisters is beautifully acted as ever by Conleth Hill with Sean Bean playing his part to perfection as well.Arya who has faced the trauma of escaping while her teacher Syrio fought off Lannister soldiers and fleeing from her households slaughter is now living as a street urchin and hears her father is being taken to the Sept of Baelor so runs to see. A hugely impactful scene ensues which provides an epic moment in the series and shows how Game of thrones is different and superior to other shows around.Another awesome episode in this fabulous first season. 10/10.",

                    "content": "Without a doubt, \"Baelor\" is the best episode of this season so far. The ending is an absolute shocker, and one of the best endings you will ever see. My feelings for Joffrey, the snivel brat king, took a deep dive. When a character makes you so angry through his actions, that means you have quite the memorable character. You gotta feel for poor Ned. He was an honest, trustworthy man who kept his code to the end. As the sword was about to take off his neck, through King Joffrey's orders, I was shocked by such a powerful moment.While Ned and the Starks were the important part of the episode, the centerpiece belonged to Tyrion. Peter Dinklage created many Emmy-worthy performances and he has many of them here at use. We learn a little more about his tragic backstory and his doomed first marriage, but he remains as funny and snarky as ever. He even gets to suffer a war wound, much to the surprise of his father. One of the best sequences here is the \"Have I Ever\" game that Tyrion played with Bronn and Shae, a woman that Bronn found. We delve deeper into Tyrion's past while maintaining a humorous vibe. Tyrion was also ordered to be the army's vanguard against the Stark army, where he gets injured with a hammer.Back in the capital of Westeros, Joffrey originally promises that Ned's life will be spared after Sansa begs for mercy. With the backing of Cersei, Joffrey agrees. He agrees only on the condition that Ned admits he is a traitor. Ned is adamant at first on not doing anything for a person like Joffrey, but he realizes he needs to protect his children. He has a nice conversation with Varys admitting he does not fear death because he is a soldier. As for Arya, she escaped the clutches of the Lannisters and lives in King's Landing as a peasant. But in the end, she sees what is truly happening to her father. Something that no child should ever witness.As we go across the Narrow Sea, it becomes clear that the Dothraki invasion will not be happening anytime soon. From what seems to be a minor wound, this week has Khal Drogo knocking on death's door with nothing but a witch to aid him. Daenerys figures out she doesn't have much power without Drogo backing her up. But at least we can figure out that Jorah Mormont is a loyal ally to her.We do not spend much time in the North at the Wall, but the little time we spend there still has Jon contemplating his values. He wants to join his brother in war against the Lannisters, but then again, he made a commitment to the Black. A commitment that cannot be broken unless he wants to die. Master Aemon tells him as much when he recounts his Targaryen lineage that used to be on the throne.As for Robb, he becomes a valuable general here. Richard Madden certainly is taking his character to another level. With each passing episode, I become more enamored with his character. He was also able to capture a certain Lannister prisoner. Cersei will certainly not be happy! I also liked the addition of David Bradley as Walder Frey, a sleazy old man with a wife whose age could be his granddaughter's. Creepy old man! But this British thespian is great at playing these kinds of characters, so it should be no surprise he does it well here. We definitely will see more of him considering Robb is engaged to one of the Freys.Game of Thrones reached its season's peak with this incredible episode. The ending is shocking, and it serves as a launching pad for what is to come next. These scenes are truly heartbreaking. When Ned sees his two daughters for the last time, I nearly lost it. You could tell that this execution was not planned. The shocked look on Cersei's face was pure golden. These are the moments that we truly live for in this series. One could forgive the fact that there were tons of off-camera fighting. My biggest gripe of the series is that we have not been many battles. They are only spoken about. After all, even the biggest shows have budgets....but still. Anyhow, an utterly amazing penultimate episode!My Grade: A+",

Two reasons. 1) It raises the stakes and 2) The ending is not only well-written, but more frightening and dramatic possible. The first eight episodes were great, if not spectacular, but episode 9 is where things got real and it's a classic that engaged me from beginning to end.The story is great, the writing is still perfect, the pacing is much more tighter and took it's time to develop the characters' motivations, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still excellent, the dialog is well-written, and the performances excel with the episode's dramatic moments.There are no problems that I have with this episode because I have never been blown away by an episode of a live-action TV show like this. Which is why I will tip my hat to the writers for doing a successful job in keeping engaged to what would happen to the Stark family and the Lannisters. So, overall, I'll say this once more, Baelor is a classic episode that is more frightening and dramatic. :)",

                    "content": "Khal Drogo is invincible ! Well apparently not. It's what happens when you play with sharp blades and think the power of the flesh is stronger than steel. Once Drogogo deadly wounded it was thrilling to see Daenerys struggling to command his men. In the past installment some of them proved that they cared more about their libido than the respect she deserves. It's logical after all because you can't expect the Dothraki to fully embrace her as their new Queen. For the moment she hasn't done enough for them and talks way too much for her own good. So with scavengers dangerously circling around her and considering she used the forbidden black magic to save her husband I think we should really worry about her life. However it was exciting to see her bodyguard finally fight with his sword and he looked quite chivalrous in his shiny armor ! Fly away with your damsel before it's too late !After Jon Snow's heroic saving I was expecting more undead to come back but surprisingly his arc was relatively calm. In fact the whole episode was when I had predicted some epic bloody sequences. So The Pointy End wasn't really the calm before the storm. But isn't it a bit naive to await for entertaining battles when the show is so great at developing its characters ? The discussion he had with the blind old man was almost scary and it was painful to see Jon hesitating between his watcher duty and past life as a bastard. As for the well deserved sword he received it convinced me even more than reading the novels is mandatory to appreciate the show to its maximum. Indeed I'm sure George R. R. Martin wrote about it for pages and described it in great details. I can't imagine how rewarding it must be for the long time fans to finally see these artifacts, like the Iron Throne, in motion !But the Dothraki and Jon Snow arcs were minor compared to the overwhelming Stark versus Lannister story. Dark Bronn and little big Tyrion really make a strange team ! Moreover Jerome Flynn and Peter Dinklage chemistry is delightful ! It's also interesting that their scenes oscillate between comic relief and tragedy. The top notch production also contributes to make them even more authentic. In fact one of the things I appreciate the most is their dirty look. From the costumes to the make-up, or should I say mud-up, it's hard not to believe they could actually exist and of course it's also true for Jon Snow, who hasn't taken a bath for 9 episodes now apparently. But of course things became even more challenging when Tyrion had to play his own drinking game. Learning about his love story was enlightening and revealed what's really going on between him and his brother Jaime Lannister. To tell the truth I didn't really get what happened to him, how he ended up being a Stark prisoner. For the moment I suppose they just kidnapped him after passing the gates, opened thanks to Lady Stark's bold move. The poor woman it seems her destiny is to only deal with creepy people. First her disturbed sister, now an old man who loves his young daughter way too much. As for Tyrion being knocked out the very first seconds of the battle it was both puzzling and hilarious. At first I found these ellipsed elements slightly confusing but then I quickly realized that they actually contributed to the success of Baelor. It was actually a wise decision because you can't cover everything in such a short time so leaving the rest to our wild imagination is more then welcome in the end.Last but not least with Ned's head out of the game it seems Jaime is on the verge of losing his own. Saying that I saw Joffrey's Machiavellian plan coming from miles away would be a terrible lie. Indeed little Arya just broke my heart and I naively hoped that she would somehow save the day with her tiny sword. Even Cersei was shocked when she's supposed to be the one pulling the strings. Apparently her puppet is now out of control and like in Ancient Rome it seems the kingdom will learn what it costs to grant unlimited power to an evil boy. King Caligula ? His reign has begun !",

But in the last moments of this penultimate episode of the season, it was more disappointment than a shock to see the end of Ed Stark.Though I cannot challenge the right of the writer over his characters, but as a viewer, I would have been happier to see him alive and back to Winterfell or maybe ruling the Kingdom. But I believe the death of Ed Stark gives a disappointment towards the end of the series which could have been the avoided.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 1 of 'Game of Thrones' was consistent in quality in the best of ways, all the episodes ranging from great to classic. \"Baelor\" for me is the season high-point. \"Winter is Coming\" started the season and show perfectly, equally so is how the season ends with \"Fire and Blood\". It is a tough act to follow on from \"Baelor\" and live up to that episode's quality but \"Fire and Blood\" does so.Visually, \"Fire and Blood\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well. The effects for the baby dragons are astonishingly authentic.One cannot talk about \"Fire and Blood\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All the characters are wonderfully written and layered and the acting, especially from Peter Dinklage and Maisie Williams here, is uniformly superb. Charles Dance couldn't have been more spot-on casting and Jack Gleeson relishes portraying one of the most evil characters in television.In short, perfect conclusion to a great first season. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

There's a real sense of moving on here from what came previously, of setting up the pieces on the chessboard for the next season, of getting all of the principle characters into place ready for their new adventures. Thus, the most important plot strand is Daenerys', coming into her own in a sweeping, satisfying and exceedingly dramatic fashion.",

I am watching this series because of all the hoopla about it and all he awards it keeps winning. It just wasn't available to me until now. I am so pleased to have now entered into this masterpiece. All the forces are in play. The snot nosed king sits on the throne, showing us that he has no mercy but a venomous sociopathic nature. His mother sits on his right, perhaps wondering if this boy will some day turn on her. We have his betrothed, who, in an early scene, may have intended pushing him off a bridge, several stories high. She is Ned's daughter and is aware of what a mistake she has made in promising fealty to this lizard. We have rebel forces all over the place, including the horse people. Wait for the stunning conclusion of this episode which is a game changer. Jon Snow impulsively goes off to fight and brought back by his loyal friends, but his patience is rewarded. We have Bran still out there, helpless, but aware. His mother is engaging forces with her son. Tyrion has been given a leadership position by his father (Ned's former position of the Hand of the King), who has expressed nothing but disdain for him in the past, and then starts out by disobeying one of the few requirements. When he and Joffrey come together, it's going to be very interesting, to say the least. Father wields a great deal of power. So here we go. This is going to get better and better.",

Master Luwin tells Bran and Rickon about their father's death. Robb is declared The King in the North by the lords that are following him. Tywin orders the cunning Tyrion to go to King's landing to serve as the Hand of the King as his substitute. Daenerys wakes up and learns that he son is dead and all the warriors have left them behind since Drogo is near death. Further the witch Mirri Maz Duur tells that she has revenged all the evil Drogo did to her city and people. During the night, Daenerys suffocates Drogo with a pillow. At the Wall, Jon Snow learns that his father was murdered and decides to leave Castle Black. However his friends pursue him and convince him to return. Daenerys prepares a funeral pyre for Drogo and for burning also the witch. She also puts the three dragon eggs on the pyre. Then she walks into the flame and is consumed by the fire. However in the morning she rises like a phoenix with three baby dragons. \"Fire and Blood\" is another excellent episode and season finale of \"Game of Thrones\". Now Drogo is also dead and the dragons have returned. I guess what will happen when Stannis receives Ned's letter telling that Joffrey is not the son of Robert. They will certainly claim the Iron Throne, but Tyrion is smart and has been assigned Hand of the King. I am also looking forward to see Jaime beheaded. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Fire and Blood\"",

                    "content": "In the shadow of The Wire, Six Feet Under, Deadwood, Sopranos and so on, it is hard for HBO to launch a drama and let the audience discover how good (or not) it is for themselves. Even when it is good sometimes you can feel that it knows the expectation on it and also the calibre of the company it keeps. It was this way with Boardwalk Empire, where one could feel the rather worthy air it carried from the very start \u2013 like it had to be this way because of what it was and how much it cost. To a point Game of Thrones begins the same way and the promos for it were running for months before it was shown. For the first few episodes I wasn't sure about it as it begins with a lot of talking and a lot of explaining things to the viewer to provide sufficient base on which to build. It isn't all as clunky as that sounds but I did get the feeling of being in the middle of something very complex and not being allowed to enjoy the story because of how much time was being spent explaining. The excessive nudity also felt like it was being done for the sake of it, as I didn't have enough context and character yet to care beyond the superficial.This lasted no more than a couple of episodes though because quickly the families are established, the main players are reasonably clear and I was able to concentrate on what was going on in the present rather than just the history between the various families. This history is important of course, but once the base is down, the writers can get it across to us in conversations and interactions rather than just telling us. At this point the show very much comes to life. I am not a big \"swords and fantasy\" fan, nor do I have any great desire to be lost in a world of novels where even the author struggles to keep track of who is who, but I do enjoy a good story well told and this is what Game of Thrones is. Allegiances are fleeting, characters may or may not have an agenda, all men are worthy and of their word until they aren't and so on. The plot twists and turns quite sharply at times but it doesn't overdo this, instead it lets them play out well, without rushing too fast or moving too slowly. As well as doing a great job of making it accessible and easy to follow, the writers did well to bring the emotions easily too. I felt the pain of betrayal (Stark in particular, for all his honourable naivety, caused me to catch myself at a few turns) but also the brutality of the ruling classing battling for power \u2013 we all know kingdoms are build on blood but here you really feel it and see it, to the point that even the \"good\" leaders will sacrifice 2000 men for the sake of a diversion to get closer to the prize. The cruelty of these people is evident and it makes their characters more dangerous and more compelling.After a slow start the cast also come alive. Bean begins as the big name and he is a really good character to come into this world with \u2013 in the way that so many shows and films use the \"wide-eyed newbie\" as their partner for the viewer, Bean fills that role here while also still being a powerful presence. Clarke started the show as a \"bad performance\" as her simpering character seemed to only exist for the sake of nudity; however over the season her transformation into Queen is really well done and very convincing to the point that she stood out for me as one of the stronger actors and her nudity became secondary. Headey is \"OK\" but I found her too reserved and without any way of appearing to be more than she is \u2013 she grew on me a little but I still found her limited. Beyond these the cast is deep in talent and good performances where it is the likable Harington or the extent to which Gleeson makes his Joffrey such a cowardly yet cruel c*** (there is a 10 minute YouTube video of him being slapped over and over again by Tyrion \u2013 it is a great watch). Speaking of Tyrion, Dinklage is brilliant in this role \u2013 funny, scheming, likable and very well rounded as a character \u2013 he was always welcome on the screen. I could go on with Gillen, Williams and others but, like so many HBO shows, it is hard to draw a line.Game of Thrones appears to be worthy and overly serious at first, perhaps struggling to escape the weight of the HBO logo at the start of the titles. However a few episodes in we have firm ground under our feet and the characters, plots and drama can begin. It seems complicated but it is not thanks to good writing, which is also the reason for it being so compelling. The actors, the sets, the locations and the scale of it all impress and of course the many open plots at the end will have me lining up for the second season when it comes.",

                    "content": "This, the tenth and final episode of the first season, begins where the last episode ended. Ned Stark has lost his head and his daughter Arya is whisked away from the scene, given a rough haircut and told to behave like a boy till she can be safely taken to the North. Her sister isn't so lucky; Joffrey takes her to the ramparts and forces her to look at her father's severed head. His decision to kill Ned Stark will have a widespread impact; Robb's followers declare him 'The King in the North'; Jon Snow considers abandoning his position in the Night's Watch to fight with his brother and Tywin Lannister is furious at the position Joffrey has put him in and orders Tyrion to go the King's Landing to take up the role of Hand of the King. Across the Narrow Sea, and unaffected by the events in Westeros, Daenerys learns that her son has died and while Drogo isn't dead he can't be said to be alive either. She ends his life and as his body is burnt on a funeral pyre she joins him\u0085 but does not die.After the death of the character most people would have considered the series' protagonist it was hard to see how this episode could top that moment\u0085 but I think it does. There is a mix of triumph and disaster as the characters come to terms with the news of his death. Young Maisie Williams does a great as Arya as she must hide her sadness and change her appearance to escape the clutches of the Joffrey's men and deal with boys who see her as a weedy boy and try to take her sword. Jack Gleeson is also on top form as the odious Joffrey; he makes us believe that this character is truly vile rather than a mere pantomime villain; just as we think his character can do no worse he does something shocking! His actions set things up nicely for the inevitable war that will take place in season two. That isn't the only event that gets the viewer keen to see what will come in the next season; the sight of the Night's Watch heading into the land beyond the wall promises to show us a whole new part of this world and Daenerys appearing from the pyre holding three living dragons was one of the best moments of the series so far; she is clearly destined for greatness. It isn't just these important moments that are enjoyable; even the 'lesser scenes' are gripping thanks to fine acting; a talk between Lords Baelish and Varys, Tywin showing respect for Tyrion and telling him he is to be the next Hand, Ros listening to an elderly client waffle on about 'what one needs to know about kings' without ever coming to the point and Catelyn Stark confronting the captive Jaime Lannister\u0085 each a small but impressive moment. Overall a great ending to the first season; I'm glad that I won't have to wait to watch season two.",

Robb, quite naturally, swears vengeance, and Jon Snow is determined to join him, until his friends confront him and remind him of his oath. Jaime finally admits to Catelyn something that the viewer has known since episode one. Tywin decides to send Tyrion away so *he* can function as the Hand of that despicable boy-king Joffrey. And Daenerys learns the consequences of turning to black magic when she'd wanted to save the life of Khal Drogo.This is some of the most riveting television that this viewer has seen in a while, even if he didn't see it when it originally aired. Brilliantly acted and written, this series continues to tie together its subplots in interesting ways. Part of what makes it compelling is seeing some of the characters in understandably emotional ways. This viewer had really come to like Ned, and found the finale to that last episode to be quite effective in its shock value. It's all too easy to give in to bloodlust and root on the survivors to go for good old-fashioned vengeance. Among the cast members with standout moments are Charles Dance (as always), Emilia Clarke, and Richard Madden.'Fire and Blood' is not without some welcome humour, as Baelish and Varys discuss the anatomy of a eunuch, and comes to a head with a truly glorious final reveal, whetting the appetite for the further adventures of these characters in season two.Eight out of 10.",

This episode is emotionally-charged following the beheading of Ned Stark and what I really like is how we see each family member affected by his death. The episode has a tense, angry feel to it and it seems like vengeance is in the air. Plus the very ending....is just wow. Emilia Clarke is proving herself to be a wonderful actress. In this episode, \"Fire and Blood,\" the execution of Ned Stark has the Stark family in an emotional showdown. Robb Stark promises vengeance on the Lannisters. Meanwhile, Arya escapes from King's Landing and begins to travel up north. Jon Snow must decide whether he will be a Ranger or fight with Robb. Vaenary realizes keeping Drogo alive may not be the right thing to do. Tywin Lannister decides to send Tyrion to King's Landing to act as Hand of the King. Overall, this is one of the best episodes in the first season if not the very best. The ending is magnificent and it will definitely affect future seasons. A lot happens in the episode, so be sure not to blink an eye. My Grade: A+",

I need to mention great performances in this episode from Emilia Clarke, Iain Glenn, Michelle Fairley, Sophie Turner, Richard Madden and Kit Harrington. I have praised Little Maisie Williams as Arya Sark several times over previous episodes of the first season, and her performance is no less than you would expect from her, but she is given less to do here than one might hope. (Though we do see her turn the tables on a fat bully called Hot Pie who tries to steal Needle from her) Peter Dinklage shares a great scene with Charles Dance, when Tywin makes Tyrion the acting Hand of the King. Like Williams I have praised Dinklage an awful lot during the first season, and their performances have made the characters two of my favourites. With Daenerys and Jon Snow tying for third. The final moments of the episode, one of the most iconic scenes in the whole of the series are a wow moment. Bring on season 2",

We continue to get dramatic developments, engaging character based scenes and an exciting ending leaving us full of anticipation for season 2.Season 1 follows the first book in the A Song of Ice and Fire book series pretty closely and a lot of the content and flow of this episode continue to do that and a lot of great dialogue is adapted closely from the source material. There are though a couple of scenes added into the mix such as an emotional scene when Robb and Catelyn react to the devastating news about Ned and the scene where Catelyn faces Jaime after they capture him. These are very good additions as both scenes are powerful and they fit nicely into the flow of the episode.Dany awakes from her traumatic childbirth to discover the 'healer' she trusted has betrayed that trust and not only has her child died but Drogo is not saved in the way she expected. The sadness of this scenario is well depicted and the interestingly ambiguous presentation of the actions of Mirri Maz Duur who has cruelly destroyed Dany's life even though Dany saved her. The 'maegi' presents her side of it which is that her life was destroyed by the Dothraki and she was stopping Drogo and his son from wreaking havoc on the world. It is left to us to judge or possibly see both sides equally.Jon's loyalty to his family is in sharp conflict with his loyalty to the Night's Watch having just made his oath before finding out his brother was riding South to war over their father's death. The book is able to present his inner conflict and his change of heart rather better but the way it is done with the main events and the great conversation with Mormont from the book done superbly well means it still works very well.We get a great scene between Tywin and Tyrion with Tywin realising he can trust Tyrion to go to King's Landing and try to gain control over Joffrey who has idiotically beheaded Ned just as Jaime has been captured. Charles Dance and Peter Dinklage shine as does the dialogue.Robb's followers declare him King in the North in a rousing scene and their new prisoner Jaime has us enthralled waiting to see how this will all pan out in the next series.Arya is taken by Yoren to meet her new travelling companions, men and boys bound for the Night's Watch including Gendry. This is very nicely done and Maisie Williams continues to hugely impress as Arya.The finale with Dany and Drogo's funeral pyre is a good wow moment to end on and signs off a magnificent season of brilliant drama.Another episode that is clearly 10/10.",

Definitely keep your eyes peeled open because you do not want to miss a thing. Considering Ned's abrupt execution, this episode has an emotional and rather angry feel to it. The Starks will definitely not go down without a fight. But seeing the lifeless head of Ned's during the cold open was certainly an emotional stab. If there were any complaints one was to have, many of the plot points were not concluded. Instead, many of the pieces are put in place for what promises to be an action-packed, higher-budgeted second season.The Starks are in shock after Ned's death. Sansa (Sophie Turner at her best here) realizes that it may be best to suck up to the brat that is King Joffrey, thanks to the advice from the Hound. It may be her only way to survive. Arya decides to head North to reunite with Jon and take the Black. Maisie Williams has been a bright spot all season long and continues to do so here. Her interaction with the bully Hot Pie is a wonderful scene. Robb Stark continues to show excellent leadership and has been named \"King of the North.\" With not much time to emote over Ned's death, Robb and Catelyn seek revenge on the Lannisters. Jon, meanwhile, is in some sort of dilemma. He must come to the decision whether to join Robb or stay in the Night's Watch. Sam may be able to help him make the decision.Emilia Clarke has really grown as an actress over the course of the season, and she really comes into her own here as Daenerys. With Drogo in a catatonic state and unlikely to recover, Daenerys must make some hard decisions-even if one of these decisions is saying farewell to her husband. Drogo really grew on me and it was sad to see him go the way he did. He should have perished in battle, not smothered by a pillow. But due to these circumstances, one can understand. What happens next is yet another game-changing cliffhanger. The dragon eggs, which have been hinted at all season, have hatched. The naked Daenerys walked through fire and survived that walk with three baby dragons by her side. This sequence is iconic for the series, and it lays groundwork for the upcoming seasons.With the execution of Ned creating a ripple across the land of Westeros, Tywin Lannister sends Tyrion to act as Hand of the King for Joffrey as he continues to wage his battles. Tywin was impressed with Tyrion's ability to give advice amidst his usage of dry wit. This is the perfect role for Tyrion, and he will surely impress giving Joffrey a slap in the face that he sorely needs. With Jaime captured by the Starks, and Cersei almost incapacitated this episode, I can tell the Lannisters just about had it with Joffrey. Especially with the Starks, Renly, and the still unseen Stannis Baratheon breathing down their necks.Overall, this has been an excellent season. The ending of the season has been built up appropriately and this episode is perhaps the best episode of the season. While it may not conclude things effectively, we see where everyone is going for Season 2. Perhaps next season will bring us more action, but I am very interested to see how these dragons will be used. Director Alan Taylor created a visual, entrancing finale so be prepared for some satisfaction to end the season.My Grade: A+",

And the music score from Ramin Djawadi hits the emotional moments really well. Much like the previous episode, I have no problem at all with this episode. I'm glad I decided to review the entire first season and only eleven more days until Season 6 arrives. So, overall, another classic episode that is more emotional and satisfying.

There're shows you keep worrying about. Will the next episode deliver ? You have doubts, you lose faith or you keep being disappointed over and over. But very quickly we learned that Game of Thrones plays in its own league. There will be a before and after it because it redefined how fantasy should be pictured on TV. Fire and Blood was in the same vein as the other nine episodes but it bore the steamy pressure of being the last installment of a stellar series that transported millions of viewers over the rainbow. Who could possibly expect it to be better than Winter is Coming ? Comparing them in terms of quality doesn't really make any sense because I think it's wiser to consider the episodes as a whole. Yes because season one was, is and will ever be a living organism of its own.I don't know if watching the show changed your life but as a reviewer it opened my eyes.

Should I watch the next episode ? Pure heresy ! You can't resist the irresistible. Indeed from its inspiring substance to its award-winning production everything about this ultimate episode was excellent, and the whole show by extension. First all arcs were properly covered and even Bran was back ! Jon Snow new friends helped him choose his path. Little big Tyrion was forced to become the new hand of the king. As I wished for Arya is now a tiny Joan of Arc version and as expected the fainting Sansa is stronger than she seemed. Sophie Turner's performance was impressive considering the extreme emotions she had to play. The second element that made the finale so exceptional was the considerable amount of eye-popping or epic scenes. Robb Stark proclaimed King of the North by his men was epic and the smile on his face was majestic ! Richard Madden's talent made Sean Bean's sudden departure less painful. Ned lost his head but his soul moved to his eldest son's body. But of course the impact it had on us was nothing compared to peeping the old counselor faking insanity around Littlefinger's charming worker and his hunchback before entering the iron stage. The show is a casting model when it comes to leveraging the acting experience of the ancients !Otherwise what we will really dream about is the last sequence featuring Daenerys and her magnificent babies. Seeing her delicate body among smoking ashes hosting freshly hatched dragons was oneiric. The T-Rex attack in Jurassic Park, Dragonheart seamless visual effects and now the rebirth of House Targaryen. Long live the Queen ! Such fantastic appearances are rare on TV and the last time I was so enchanted by them was probably while watching Primeval. However here the legendary animals looked as much as real as the dire wolves ! The odyssey was so epic that waiting for season 2 could be a living nightmare but in my opinion that inevitable break is a blessing. Indeed it'll leave latecomers like me the precious time they need to finally read A Song of Ice and Fire ! Fire and Blood ? A chalice of sacred water that revitalized our every cells and boosted our imagination.",

It's just an episode that teaches how to do a finale. Tie off loose ends, end every arc for the season, and deliberately say what's gonna happen in Season 2 all while producing it's own shock and twists in its own way. These are all done magnificently in Game of Thrones' Season 1 Finale Fire and Blood. The season started a bit slow, but if you're a fan of this show you know that you'll be intrigued throughout the whole season and only makes you hyped to watch the better upcoming seasons. It is definitely one of the best seasons of the show since the Starks are all together here before being separated in the upcoming seasons. I would rate this season like a 9.5/10. A near perfect season that encapsulates the main families' philosophies all while producing it's own intrigue and suspense.",

But that is definitely the only disappointing thing to find with this season finale. Directly continuing where 'Baelor' left off, 'Fire and Blood' shows us the dramatic aftermath of Eddard Stark's beheading. We see the reaction of every Stark family member and those scenes are some of the emotionally best in the series yet. After that, the matter changes somewhat too quickly, and Robb Stark's army is back to planning for war with all of them now recognizing the eldest Stark child as the true king of Westeros, however, this was also a very interesting moment. Preventing the story from dragging in the middle part are a great conversation between Tyrion and his father and Daenerys waking up again (in case you've forgotten: there was some serious stuff going on with her in the last episode too!)The only part that wasn't as good as it could've been was, once again, the storyline at the Night's Watch. Unfortunately, some of the acting was weak and the pacing didn't work very well either. All in all, I didn't feel as thrilled as I felt when I saw 'Baelor' for the first time. But then, there comes this awesome final scene that will impress the hell out of you. Emilia Clarke is completely Emmy-worthy in these last five minutes and the closing shot is freaking amazing.I really liked almost everything about 'Fire and Blood' and I would say that it's the 3rd best episode of GoT's first season. It's utterly entertaining and I could hardly think of a better way to end this excellent first season.",

                    "content": "Game of Thrones is a show which delivers in all aspects that you would hope a big budget TV show would, and Season 1 is by far the strongest of all seasons to date. I have viewed the first season three times and have read the book twice, the adaption from book to the TV screen is simply faultless. This is true for season 1 at least however I am aware that in the later series differences between novel and show become all too common.With the first season being a perfect adaptation we are treated to the original dialogue and scripting which is such an amazing piece of work, I haven't seen many shows which deliver on this as well as Game of Thrones. Much of the show is a word for word copy of the novel which is always great to see, staying true to the book ensures we get the full experience, intended by the author. George R.R. Martin had a vital role in the production of the earlier seasons, being very hands on and controlling over how he wanted it to be portrayed.The first two episodes are relatively slow paced as characters are introduced and back stories are touched upon, from there on though it really starts to pick up momentum. Having fewer characters and families to focus on means that the pacing and storytelling moves very freely and flows at a rate which is very easy to follow and very easy to get addicted to. The Starks, Lannisters and Daenerys are the main focus over the 10 episodes, with the story also covering John Snow and the Nights Watch at the Wall. Characters aren't black and white, they have depth, different sides to them, many have mystery, with qualities you like and dislike. All characters are unique and from early on you start to get a gist of who is good and bad, likable and unlikeable.Game of Thrones isn't an action series however; its main strength is its dialogue, character relationships, character development and sublime story telling. The action we do see though is spectacularly violent and graphic, to the point where people have questioned the extremes of it. Seeing uncut gore and violence in something as mainstream as this is refreshing to see, language and sexual content are also very common with very little being held back. Game of Thrones excels in the 'shock factor', so often do things happen which come as a complete surprise, the first season alone has several of these moments, with each episode ending on an intriguing note, making you want to see what happens next. This can however be frustrating as for example, episode 3 could end on a cliff hanger with certain character and we may have to wait until episode 5 to be taken back to that particular storyline. This isn't an issue if you are binge watching the show but if you are watching it 1 episode weekly as it is aired it could become annoying.The amount of work that has gone into this is quite staggering, all the sets and costumes are fantastic and you can really tell that they haven't taken any short cuts during production. The filming locations are spot on, mixed in with the right amount of CGI, it brings the world to life with total realism. As Characters move around to different locations so often, much work has gone into the sets so we know instantly where they are, helping us keep up with the fast pace. Kings Landing, The Wall and Winterfell are all very distinguishable within seconds of new scenes.Game of Thrones makes a bold statement that it doesn't hold back when it comes to controversial subjects. It tackles them full on, showing complete ignorance to the easily offended, saying 'if you don't like it, simply do not watch it', and I respect that, very much.For me, the show declines in later series. George R.R. Martin has much more control over this season and it is very evident, especially when you have watched all seasons back to back. But as this is a review of Season One alone, I honestly cannot fault it and I would rate it as highly as any TV I have ever seen.A very easy 10/10.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The North Remembers\" was a great Season 2 opener. Season 1 was of a consistently high standard, with its best episodes especially \"Baelor\" being 'Game of Thrones' high points, so of course expectations would be high. Luckily, \"The North Remembers\" lives up. Occasionally it's slightly rushed and it is agreed that the Littlefinger threatening Cersei to her face scene was just silly and not something Littlefinger would characteristically do. On the most part though, it's an exposition-heavy episode where almost all of it works, a lot happens and is introduced and it's handled in a lean way. The scene setting and the introduction of many characters and subplots were deftly balanced.Everything with Joffrey and the expansion of Tyrion's role were everything good.Visually, \"The North Remembers\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The North Remembers\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All the characters are wonderfully written and layered, and the acting from especially humorous and ever growing Tyrion and Jack Gleeson's repellent Joffrey is superb.Overall, great start to Season 2. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

He confronts his mother calling her out for her responsibility in driving his father to produce bastards all over the kingdom, then sending out assassins to kill them, including a small child and a baby. Of course, the most dangerous of these would be Jon Snow. We see Tyrion gaining the position of Hand to the King, showing little if any respect for his master. Once again, the smallest person in the series, dominates the screen. He is the survivor, the intellectual, the true predictor of actions. There are other aspects of the wars going on with the multiple kings. Once again, there are so many irons in the fire and it is becoming difficult to interpret the alliances.",

Now Stannis claims the Iron Throne and will fight the War. Littlefinger believes that knowledge is power but Cersei shows him that power is power actually. The slaughter of babies and children is impressive to keep the throne for Joffrey. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"The North Remembers\"",

                    "content": "The action in this episode follows on from the end of the previous season and concentrates on reminding us where each of the protagonists is now. Opening in King's Landing we see King Joffrey is as unpleasant as ever as he watches knights fighting to the death and orders one, who turns up drunk, to be forced to drink a cask of wine; only kind words from Sansa save the man's life. Tyrion arrives at King's Landing to act as Hand of the King while his father is fighting Robb Stark's forces in the North. Across the Narrow Sea things aren't going well for Daenerys and her people; they are deep in the desert and know that many locals would kill her for her dragons rather than help. North of the wall Jon Snow and the other members of the Night Watch accept the hospitality of Craster; a man who lives with his many wives, who are also his daughters! We are also introduced to another of the claimants to the Iron Throne, Stannis Baratheon, and his sorceress Melisandre.Inevitably as this episode concentrates on reminding the viewers where most of the major characters are now there is less plot advancement and action than most episodes. This doesn't mean it is boring though; the violent opening reminds us that this is a dangerous place where the slightest offence towards those in power can mean a cruel death. The introduction if Stannis and Melisandre promises to be interesting; both grab the viewers' attention as he pulls a flaming sword from a fire and she drinks from a chalice she knows to be poisoned and survives. Satannis's spreading of the news of Joffrey's parentage has immediate repercussions as Joffrey moves to kill any child who may have been fathered by the late King Robert. Jack Gleeson does a fine job as the repellent Joffrey as he avoids making him a pantomime villain. Amongst all these events the only real disappointment was the fact that Arya barely featured\u0085 and that was just an unspeaking appearance at the end. Overall though a good episode that effectively brought me back in to the world of 'Game of Thrones' and left me looking forward to watching the rest of the season.",

We pick up right where the first season left off amidst the turmoil occurring in the land of Westeros. As like it was in the first season, we seem to be getting plenty of strong performances and there are some new characters introduced such as the brothers of the late Robert Baratheon. The production design looks very sharp, sharper than your average television show. In this episode, \"The North Remembers,\" Tyrion Lannister arrives in Kings Landing where he is to act as the new King of the Hand. Meanwhile, Robb Stark ponders what to do next in the war, The Night Watch decide to trek north to figure out what is happening beyond the wall. Stannis Baratheon decides he is the rightful heir of the Iron Throne. Finally, Daenarys is out in the desert with what's left of her people struggling to survive. Overall, this is a solid start to the second season. It's an episode that is pretty much the aftermath of the last episode of the first season, but it introduces a path in which this season will take. Great acting is the key to the success of this show. I have a feeling that this will be Peter Dinklage's time to shine. My Grade: A-",

Stannis Baratheon plots an invasion to claim his late brother's throne, whilst Daenerys (Emilia Clarke), her three young dragons and khalasar trek through the Red Waste in search of allies, or water.The opening of the episode starts strongly but at times scenes feel slightly rushed. the sparkling presence of Tyrion Lannister, played by Peter Dinklage (Who deservedly won an Emmy for his work in the first season) is a breath of fresh air whenever he's in a scene, easily dancing around Joffrey's and Cersi'z jibes. I particular liked the scene where he offers his condolences to, and is assessing (you can see it in his eyes) how Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) has found a way to survive, by saying the words they expect. And when he discusses getting Jamie back form the Stark's \"you had three Starks to trade. You chopped ones head off, you let another escape.... Father would be disappointed.\" Another scene I liked, was one with Robb, Jaime a very large direwolf in Grey Wind. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldauand Richard Madden both do a fine job.My big complaint with this episode would be the absence of Arya (played Maisie Williams, who I was a big fan of last season) except for the very last shot of the episode. All in all, this episode has some of the same problems that the show had in its premiere last year: a lot of ground to cover, and not enough time. And that's why I suspect I quick shot of Arya was just tacked on the end.",

Who could possibly need a recap for such a show ? It's not like if we hadn't spent the last past months thinking and dreaming about it. Still seeing all the major events in such a short time was exciting and when the title sequence began its stellar dance I had already plunged into the forgotten realms.I feel calm and around my head gravitates dozens of captivating televisual ideas. I see her angelic figure lost like an oasis in the desert and a fragile dragon as real as it gets. I feel the cold breath of a golden axe and the bitter smell of blood that follows. I hear their atmospheric voices, laugh of his wit jokes and wonder if I'm not hallucinating. A pagan and charming confusion, then a whore above a rocky CG Babylon. Can such an overwhelming production be real or have all my neurons already been scattered by this close encounter ?A comet. What a majestic refrain to transition between the burning screams of the North and the cold ballads of the South. An irresistible Tyrion, a repelling tyrant. An educative tale. What an entertainment way to be a better leader, a better child, a better human. I have looked into the eye of the beholder. I saw a disgusting pig surrounded by young wives and ready to get slayed by thousands of flying knives. I drank sacred water to stimulate my senses and be as frightening as a dire wolf ready to cut your filthy throat. I have never been so lost in medieval times and still I can feel the ground beneath my feet. I'm at war. We're in love. I'm a dragon !

                    "content": "After director Timothy Van Patten introduced us to this epic series with the two captivating initial episodes, episodes 3-8 were engaging but slightly less convincing. Timothy Van Patten is an HBO veteran since \"Sex and the City\" and from \"Sopranos\" and \"The Pacific\" fame and was the right choice fine-tuning the take on this seductive and succulent source material. Having tackled two episodes of the perfect pitch period piece \"Rome\" and giving directorial birth to \"Game of Thrones\" he is now largely involved in \"Boardwalk Empire\", the other current HBO blockbuster and critically-acclaimed show.Alan Taylor, also involved in \"Sex and the City\", \"Sopranos\" and \"Boardwalk Empire\" too some lesser degree, worked on my all-time favourite series \"Six Feet Under\" and also on remarkable and more relevant \"Rome\". He arrives for Episodes 9 and 10 of season 1 of \"Game of Thrones\" and ups the game in almost all levels of storytelling. Now in season two he is in charge of the first two episodes including this one who is the best episode this series has seen thus far. Watching episode 3 of this second season, it became apparent that the show is not the same without Alan Taylor! Thankfully he directs two other episodes I have yet to see, later in this season. However, he is not slated to direct in season 3 as he is now involved with a Marvel feature film for Thor...All that said, this \"The North Remembers\" episode is to be remembered. From the beginning with King Joffrey's birthday celebration and sadistic humour interrupted by submissive Sansa Stark and new appointed Hand uncle Tyrion Lannister with a crisp arrival to King's Landing to the final murderous scenes, including brutal infanticide, that end the episode, every shot, dialogue and the specific and overall tones are on point. This is a strong episode on its own and also perfect resolution of last season's remaining questions as well as setting up the story lines for a potential exciting season 2. The next episode \"The Night Lands\" is also top notch, so here hoping other directors will follow Alan Taylor's lead and elevate the series with better scenes, acting, tension and pace.",

                    "content": "The second season's first episode takes us right back to George R. R. Martin's fantastic creation Westeros and as soon as the HBO logo has left the screen and the legendary opening credits start, it feels as if we have never left this amazing fantasy world. In the very first scene, underage asshole king Joffrey reminds us why we all hate him so much while also delivering an immensely entertaining scene that directly merges into another one involving the only two characters that are even more entertaining than Joffrey: his mother and his uncle, Cersei and Tyrion Lannister. The two have a heated debate during the Small Council that has Tyrion delivering this episode's most rememberable one-liner, \"It must be hard for you to be the disappointing child.\" This marks as the first real confrontation between those two and it is awesome. The fierce chemistry between the mutually abhorring brother and sister is magnificent and shows the enormous acting qualities of Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey. Because of this scene, the episode has already had its top point in the first ten minutes, but that isn't really bothering since the simple comeback of all those great characters that we learned to love or hate (sometimes both) in the first season is absolutely great. Some scenes admittedly lack the tension and fantastic screen writing that the one with Cersei and Tyrion had, yet the further evolving of the different characters is enough to keep anyone who liked Game of Thrones in its primal season delighted. Additional intensity comes from a new setting that involves Stannis Baratheon, rightful claimant for the Iron Throne, and television's hottest redhead since Christina Hendricks in Mad Men. It's hard to grasp what is exactly going on in \u2013 where are those scenes set, for Christ's sake? -, but future episodes will surely give more insight into Stannis, Melisandre (a.k.a. \"Hot Redhead\"), and the other characters involved. The introduction to this location was definitely very well-done, however, I remember to have been way more swept away by how they presented us all the settings in season one.All the other basic locations of the series return as well, with the Night Watch part going into a whole new direction that seems utterly appealing to me. The scenes at the Stark camp are quite good, especially the argument between Robb Stark and his captive Jaime Lannister; while the five minutes in which we travel across the Narrow Sea to find neo-dragon mother Daenerys and her extremely exhausted 'khalasar' are a bit unfulfilling. It's sad that not even dragons can help those scenes get any more interesting, they still are the weakest fraction of the series, like we were used to it previously.All in all, we shouldn't forget that this is one of the visually best TV series of all time and the whole look ranging from cinematography and editing to make-up, costumes, and set design is absolutely grand. And though creators David Benioff and Dan Weiss start to deviate from the novels more remarkably at this point, it's still a fantastic adaption. I believe my high rating for this episode is warrantable since the weaker parts really don't carry weight that much and it's just tremendously entertaining to watch.",

He is not letting anyone butcher his baby and that's why it is so awesome. The casting is wonderful. So many new faces mixed with a bunch of well known celebrities make the characters really come to life and I imagine their faces when I read. The wardrobe and make up are stunning, the locations are beautiful and really seem Westeros and Essos, the FX, the plot is genius, the dialog too, and the small changes from the book are a success.In this episode, we take up exactly where we left. It is amazing how everything is so real, even when it's fantasy. Good guys do bad things, bad guys have hard times, good ones too, sometimes it is not even clear who the bad guys are. Some facts that are clearly explained in the books have to be conveyed by images and voices that's why we see:.Joffrey taking off his boy-mask to show the ruthless ambitious sadistic psychopath he is. Even to his own mother. Can a king like this really rule? Great scene with Cersei..Cersei carries on her plans, like eliminating the bastards and showing Petyr who's the boss. But she knows she raised a monster, she has to deal with Tyrion and Jaime is missing. She is actually reaping what she sew. I really like the actress, I think she is doing a great job..I totally love what they did to Robb Stak. Totally worth seeing. In the book he is much younger but here it is a really strong character and the huge direwolf gives him such a halo of power that he is even better than Eddard. We all want to see him rip off Joffrey's head right now! Will life be so just? .Tyrion becomes Hand, and we all think \"Gee, look at Tywin making a good decision...\" Let's all hope he brings some wits into King's Landing. Nice man Tyrion, you have to be a dwarf to be a little bit of a humble Lannister. He always steals the scene..Sansa is living the real nightmare having to comply with the king's every whim. Will destiny smile at her and she'll escape? Or will life be a bitc* and Joff might kill her (or worse)? .Jon Snow and the brothers reach Craster's. And like they say \"there are no laws beyond the wall\". Nice scene too with the Old Bear..Arya follows Yoren north as an orphan boy, that continues to show the incredible strength in this young and female character. .We were all hoping to see Daenerys conquer half of Essos, but the truth is that the dragons are babies, the Red Waste is an awful desert and she is the queen of a bunch of homeless starving dirty souls. Also great female character that steals the scenes when she appears.With this set forward it is clear to the viewers that we can expect anything in this season. Pretty much like life itself, unpredictable.",

Even his decisions appear to be rushy, like he is not too sure about what he's doing.Meanwhile, in King's Landing, king Joffrey is the antipode of Rob Stark. Despite being younger than him, he behaves like a little tyrant, and even his mother is kind of afraid of his actions. Good acting of the actor.Finally, there's an analogy between a woman who has made up a religion to convert Stannis and his people, and Christianity. Good metaphor of how people are able to abandon the religion of their ancestors in exchange of the mystic and the sensual.",

But when Ned's head was chopped off, Joffery wasn't the true heir and Robb has crowned himself as The King in the North, I couldn't wait any longer. So I decided to read the books. Now I'm watching this show from a different perspective and I am still amazed how well this episode was played out.\"The North Remembers\" shows us how much this show will now jump around. With Ned Stark dead, there is no real center role to keep everything together. Even though Tyrion (played by Peter Dinklage who won an Emmy and Golden Globe for Supporting Actor last year) is now considered the overall fan favorite, he still fits in the supporting actor role; and it's better that way. The season will jump around a lot from Daenerys and her dragons to Robb Stark and his ongoing war against the Lannisters. For those who had problems remembering plot and characters from Season 1 might want a note pad handy - because it doesn't get any easier in Season 2.The season premiere was all about showing where everyone is. I loved how it opened; they show King Joffery and much of a monster he has become by nearly drowning a knight in wine. I also loved that Tyrion is finally in King's Landing serving as Hand of the King that his sister, Queen Cersei, is not too happy about. Across the Narrow Sea, the episode showed Daenerys and her dragons heading east for shelter or civilization. While we were only able to see on dragon, it looked beautifully made. Robb Stark, the King in the North, sends his peace terms to King's Landing and wants the North to be separate from the Kingdom forever. We also see his wolf, that has grown since we have last seen it, test the imprisoned Jamie Lannister. The episode also shows Jon Snow north of the wall and we are told that a new king has also risen beyond the wall.The episode shows some new faces. Stannis Baratheon, only mentioned in Season 1, finally comes on screen during a ritual that dealt with burning the old gods for the new God of Light that a sorceress, Melisandre, is performing. Stannis has declared himself the rightful heir to the Iron Throne and declares war on King Joffery.Yes, the episode is full of information. They throw a lot at you and since this is only a ten episode season, it's required to show so much information. Having said that, they did a marvelous job of bringing the book to the TV screen. The little game between Cersi and Littlefinger (also known as Lord Baelish) was tremendous and shows what power really is. The ending with all of King Robert's bastard sons was beautifully done. Though I wish we could have seen more Arya (who only appears before the credits role), everything else about it was fantastic.\"The North Remembers\" was about bringing everyone up to speed again and now the show should continue with great pace. This is a 1000 page book they are trying to squeeze into ten episodes. So far, the show is doing beautifully. I can't wait to see how everything else is played out. Even though I have read the book, I am still eager to \"see\" what happens next.9.4/10",

                    "content": "Finally,the wait is over for HBO brilliant and fantastic Game Of Thrones second season but which is any good or even better. the first episode of the second season already has so many intrigue from a scenery of a blazing red comet pass down in the sky to killing a baby,this season is definitely going to be a lot darker than the first season of this epic fantasy series. the story begin with the new monster king Joffrey and Sansa witnessed the hound butcher another knight in a tournament that was held for the king amusement and Joffrey forced Sansa to enjoy the tournament but Sansa was only pretending to enjoy the fight,when suddenly the charismatic Tyrion appear before Joffrey and Sansa.as usual Peter Dinklage steal the scene right away with his charming performance being a sharp tongue Tyrion Lannister,he has proved that he still got something that made him won last year golden globe.meanwhile back in the north Brand is still haunted by his premonition about the coming winter and dreams about the red omen in the sky.although his story didn't really get much of an improvement but it shows that there is still a constant character building on brand story. in the south,Daenerys was struggling in her journey to reclaim the throne despite having some dragon,mainly because neither Daenerys or her brother didn't know a thing about raising a dragon so she has to face the reality of only having a baby dragon and small follower even thought she was eager to take back the iron throne,fortunately she still has the brave and wise Ser Jorah Mormont accompany through out her journey. in the scene,Emilia Clarke was great in portrayed the struggled Daenerys even after manage to hatch some of her dragon egg,she just has that innocent look on her face that make you care about her character Daenerys even thought her character has made the first episode a bit look like a soap opera set in medieval times,nevertheless her acting was superb in this first episode.then we are introduce to the one and only Stannis Baratheon,who happens to be the true heir of the kingdom was now having a ritual of converting his religion into his wife new religion praising a so-called \"God of Light\" although his elder has warned him not to betray the old god but the stubborn Stannis disobey his warning and he choose to convert his old belief.in this season we are introduce to Stannis Baratheon played by actor Stephen Dillane,who plays the character convincing but somehow lack of intimidation although the novel has describe the character Stannis Baratheon as an intimidating and fearsome leader but it is early to judge from the appearance since it is still the first episode and an introduction to the character.these are the main plot of the first episode beside there are some interesting new character being introduce,there is also some of the old character show their other side such as little finger being easily disturb when Cerces mocked his status of being one of the honorable lord and Rob looking more fierce and brave than ever before,when he intimidate Jamie with his dire wolf and when he learn to stand up for himself in front of his mother.beside introduction and character development,there were also a brutal scene where a baby was killed in little finger whorehouse and near the end of the episode,a boy was drown into the water by one of the city guard,these scene are a little disturbing but it also help to build the suspense in the end of episode.so the answer to the question was yes,the new season is definitely going to be better than season one beside its more brutal and bloody aspect that we likely to see often in this new season but the intriguing plot and superb acting will attract new viewer,while the fan will be craving for more of game of thrones in days to come.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.After a great Season 2 premiere in \"The North Remembers\", \"The Night Lands\" continues the high standard. It doesn't introduce as many plot lines or characters while still being exposition-heavy. Despite how that sounds this proved to be a good move due to much of the exposition being interesting and well-written, adding a lot to the characterisation. \"The Night Lands\" is moodier and darker than most episodes before it, certainly more so than \"The Night Remembers\" but no less intriguing.Will admit to have done without the sexual elements, they seemed gratuitous and could easily have been left out due to adding nothing to the characters or the story. That way, some of the pace could have been tightened. That is my sole complaint of an otherwise great episode.Visually, \"The Night Lands\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Night Lands\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All the characters are wonderfully written and layered, liked the expansion of Arya, and the acting from especially Peter Dinklage and Kit Harrington is superb all round.To conclude, great. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

                    "content": "This, the second episode of the second season once again offers us an insight into what is going on in various parts of the world its characters inhabit. On the road north we see Arya Stark showing that she is just as spirited when she is away from the protection of her family; she easily matches the boys with her sharp tongue and with her short hair she passes for a boy; at least to most of her fellow travellers; Gendry realises she is a girl and ultimately learns her true identity and they become friends. Back in King's Landing Joffrey's actions in having any of the late king's potential illegitimate offspring killed are having consequences; Tyrion has the Commander of the Guard replaced with Bronn and informs the queen that such actions will only help fuel an uprising amongst the poorest in society. On the Iron Islands Theon Greyjoy returns to his father for the first time in nine years and finds only contempt for what he has become\u0085 as well as having a rather embarrassing meeting with his sister. Elsewhere Davos Seaworth is working to recruit an army to fight alongside Stannis Baratheon. North of the Wall Jon learns what happens to Craster's sons. Across the Narrow Sea things still aren't going well for Daenerys.After an episode that barely featured Arya it was great to see quite a bit more of her this time; Maisie Williams is a brilliant young actress, her performance and roughly cut hair make it believable that many of those around her might mistake her for a boy. Peter Dinklage is also on top form as Tyrion Lannister; he knows just how to deliver a particularly cutting line\u0085 the scene where he deals with the soon to be ex-commander of the King's Guard was great in this regard. As well as updating us on those we know this episode gave us a great introduction to Theon's father, Balon Greyjoy, a few short lines as he lectured his son told us what we needed to know about this character. These scenes also provided some amusement when Theon, and the viewer, learn that the woman he was flirting with was his sister! It wasn't until after the episode ended that I realised it had featured no real action, unless you count the sex scenes! This didn't matter though as the story was always interesting and all of the cast did a fine job; equally it didn't matter that several major characters didn't feature. Overall another really good episode.",

I particularly loved the acting of Peter Dinklage as Tyrion. He has two key scenes that will invoke laughter. His scenes regarding the dinner and with his sister are very memorable. I also liked the acting of Maisie Williams as Arya, who also provided some amusement. But one thing that may worth keeping an eye on is the use of gratuitous sex and incest. This episode uses those a little more than usual, and it's growing a bit weary. In this episode, \"The Night Lands,\" Arya becomes friends with Gendry, a child heading to the Night Watch. Tyrion tries to add balance to the king's affairs as he pleas with Cersei to set things right. Theon Greyjoy heads home to the Iron Lands where he sees his father for the first time in nine years. Vaenarys gets news back from her messengers as she and her people lay in the wasteland. Finally, Jon Snow investigates the actions of Craster. Overall, this is a really good episode that is fun and often entertaining. The use of sex is getting a little too much though, and it's clearly not a show to watch with your children. It's a slow episode in a manner of speaking, but still a good one. My Grade: B+/A-",

On the road north, Arya (the brilliant Maisie Williams) shares a secret with Gendry, a Night's Watch recruit. Theon Greyjoy reunites with his father Balon, and sister Yara and asks them to join forces with Robb Stark. The scenes between Arya and Gendry are excellent, and Tyrion's cleaning house in King's Landing is superb. Bronn continues to be one of my favourite characters. I felt a great deal of sympathy for Theon Greyjoy as his return home to Pyke doesn't go as he planned. And Davos and Melisandre are both given more to do here, and both do the job very well. Of the new characters introduced, I have no complaints over Patrick Malahide as Balon Greyjoy, Gemma Whelan plays Yara Greyjoy well and Tom Wlaschiha is enjoyably quirky as Jaqen H'ghar, who is travelling with Arya and Gendry. This is a better episode than the last, mainly because it pays more attention to Arya's story. I became a massive fan of Maisie Williams portrayal of Arya Stark last season, and she continues to impress me this season.",

Well, no need to worry because her story arc has some plot advancement here as she makes a friend at the outskirts of the King's Landing named Gendry before he learns that she the daughter of Ned Stark as it turns out he met him before his execution. Also, the plot lines from the previous episode have been continued here including the City Watch guards searching for Gendry and Robb Stark, King of the North giving the Small Council terms (etc., etc.).The writing's still good, the performances are still great, the pacing is really good, the scenery is still gorgeous, and Ramin Djawadi continues to make more beautiful music here. My only quibble is the sex scene. Now, I heard that the first season had some sex moments but they were downplayed because it focused more on politics and character development. I won't spoil it to those who haven't seen the episode and the scene's not terrible, but I just didn't expect to have more of that here.So, overall, aside from the sex scene, The Night Lands is another great episode and continues the story lines from the first episode perfectly while advancing Arya's story arc where the last two episodes of Season 1 left off.",

However despite its cosmic qualities I have to admit that it wasn't as jaw dropping as Winter Is Coming. It featured many stellar scenes, like Daenerys taking care of her baby dragon or Jaime's hallucination, but it lacked a knocking out ending. This second episode delivered the cliffhanger we were hoping for but sadly I have to admit that it lacked some of the elements that made The North Remembers so outstanding.My first complain would be about the editing. I really missed how the parts were linked using the burning comet in the past installment. The mistake had already flawed the epic A Golden Crown in my opinion because it's inappropriate to cut sharp from one point of the kingdom to an other. So let's hope the upcoming episodes will surprise us with their creativity and fantastic metaphoras because a top notch production isn't enough. It leads us to the exotic sets because from Arya's lost woods to Theon's cliffs it felt like flying above Ireland, England and Scotland !My second major complain would go to the unbalanced development of some arcs. For instance Daenerys' one was way too short. Of course it wouldn't have been entertaining to witness their slow descent toward the river of thirst but her seeing a mirage or having a daynightmare about her precious creature could have been thrilling. In fact it seems this time the dream team behind the show decided to focus more on sexuality. The red-hot Melisandre (Carice van Houten) was back and she actually reminds me of Marion Zimmer Bradley's Avalon series. Such a feminist reference is inevitable considering the number of female characters that are now moving across the board. Theon's filthy rides were controversial and The Adventures of Lady Arya were promising. A charismatic sister, not a boy wanted by Cersei\u0085 George R. R. Martin knows his classics and Littlefinger's cheering up one of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s was well staged.The fat guy's naive attitude seemed slightly misplaced but when it comes to Snow shivers are sent down my spine every time ! It feels like Martin was possessed by Stephen King while writing it and that Frank Darabont (The Mist, The Walking Dead) was hired to adapt it. Last but not least Tyrion's candles lighted face off with Cersei was wicked, one second you laugh the next you cry, and of course all the challenging mind games were exciting to follow.Note : This review was first posted on Kritikenstein, my weblog.",

                    "content": "The Night Lands is an episode that has a lot of great stuff, but also more than just a few disappointing aspects that mitigated my general view on it. Most of all, they decided to focus on sex even more than usual, especially increasing the incestuous content to an unsurpassed high. The inbreeding parts don't get really explicit, but just the mentioning of it, together with the baby-slaughtering in the previous episode, leads me to believe that this season of Game of Thrones is going to be a lot more unsuitable for children than before. That's not to say that I disliked seeing Carice van Houten nude, I'm solely questioning its necessity, especially since that particular scene wasn't even included in the novels. Anyway, as long as you don't watch it with your kids, the episode is still really nice entertainment.First of all, we have scenes with Arya again and they are some of the funniest moments the show has had up to that point. The conversation between her and Gendry, bastard son of the late King Robert, was absolutely natural and uplifting and definitely one of the most enjoyable scenes in The Night Lands, whose best part was undoubtedly Peter Dinklage's Tyrion who was present in two scenes and nailed it each time. The first one, him having dinner with Janos Slynt, the Commander of the City Watch, is hilarious and so well acted; the second one is another debate between him and Cersei that made me laugh my arse off (to stay in Game of Thrones British English) while also giving important background information. Another very good part of this episode was Littlefinger solacing Ros, which soon turned out to be a bit more than that and showed off Littlefinger's attitude so perfectly well. What happened when Theon Greyjoy visited his family is one of the incest facets the episode has to offer while actually being very entertaining and interesting since it gives us a lot of character insight.So much for the good parts about The Night Lands; the not bad, but not really good scenes were basically everything I didn't mention in the previous paragraph. Dragonstone, the freshly introduced new setting, already got a bit boring in this episode, however, if you haven't read the source material, it will definitely help you to understand all the new characters better. The attribute 'boring' can also be given to the scenes across the Narrow Sea where Daenerys and her khalasar of some two dozen people and most of them women are planning to attack the rest of Westeros. I'm utterly convinced that this plan will work.While not boring, the Night's Watch scenes were unappealing to me right from the start as unfunny fart jokes were made, while Kit Harrington did a really fine acting job and proved that he can be just a tiny bit amusing as well. The Night Lands ended in a scene with him that is bringing up the question: Is every Game of Thrones episode now going to end with a baby being killed?My conclusion: I did enjoy this episode, yet I found it to be one of the weakest episodes of the show yet. There were too much things happening that I didn't like and if it weren't for the numerous and circumstantial sex scenes, this would've easily been the most boring Game of Thrones episode yet. Keep in mind that my rating always augments a bit because of the show's visuals that never fail to impress me.",

I don't think I ever given an episode under an 8 before. The creators should be proud of that.Season 2's second episode, while showed a lot of characters, was mainly about Theon sailing to his homeland of Pyke to talk to his father about joining Robb in his fight against the Lannisters. And after a (cough, cough) reunion with his sister, Theon's father decides to reject Robb's offer by tossing it into the fire. Even though his reward would that he would rule the Iron Islands as King, Theon's father wants to earn his reward by declaring war even though the father does not want to attack the Lannisters.If you don't remember, Ned Stark destroyed Theon's father's revolt to become King of the Iron Islands years before. And when he lost, Ned took Theon to Winterfell.Even though Theon was the main plot line, there were still great scenes to be shown. The episode first starts off by showing Arya on the road to the Wall. It was also great for Yoren (the leader of their group) threaten to kill a Gold Cloak who is looking for Gendry, King Robert's final bastard son, and kill him. It was also a great scene when Gendry tells Arya that she's a girl. Those lines is remembered right from the book. Again, the writers stick with the book's dialog and that's a good thing.The other strong point was Tyrion. He had some great scenes this episode especially with Varys and a later scene with Cersei. The Cersei scene alone was tremendous. Not only we found out that Joffery was the one who ordered the attack on Robert's bastard sons but that she knew about it. You could see that she was getting very emotional. She now knows that she has created a monster for a King.We also see Jon Snow and the ending was basically another plot twist. It seems that where they are staying, the husband is giving babies (probably sons) to the White Walkers (we haven't seen these guys sine the pilot). While it was a good twist, I wish there was more of him.Oh and Stannis screws his sorceress Melisandre . . . . moving on.While \"The Night Lands\" was a great episode, it still lacked. Daenery's one scene was way too short and we didn't see any Robb or his mother. We are now beginning to see that one episode isn't enough to show every character because there is way too much to cover. But the episode was strong though - it hasn't lost it's interest. The hour long episode went by pretty fast. I wanted more but I know I have to wait until next Sunday to see more of this season to unfold.8.8/10",

There are some alterations that, after a little thought, do serve to drive home a point more quickly and show the viewer what the books show in a very roundabout way. Those who have read the books will probably struggle with some of that.This episode was particularly bad regarding the overdose of softcore porn, but hopefully they all won't be like this going forward. When you've got as many characters and as much to tell as Martin's world contains, a lot of daylight is burned on excess bootknocking. ***spoiler*** And some of it goes against character, too. We are shown Melisandre seducing Stannis with a very particular purpose in mind, in part to explain something we'll see in a later broadcast. In the book, we know it happens, but we are not shown, and this hot and heavy scene misleads us about what was likely a pretty clinical interlude, and also about Stannis' personality.***end spoiler*** Nevertheless, a lot of the acting is still very good, and I got an excellent dose of Tyrion, so it's not as if I won't keep watching. I'm pleased they chose to keep Dolorous Edd, knowing that many characters have to be streamlined out to fit the adaptation. But I do feel the tone of this episode was below the first season's, and below the books. Hopefully next one won't disappoint.",

                    "content": "SPOILERS - Whole episode discussed! - SPOILERSAfter a fantastic premier, season 2 stays strong with another great episode.I think this episode we really notice Ned Stark's absence from the show. There no longer seems to be a lead character leading us through the show and connecting the different story lines as season 1 did. Hopefully this doesn't result in the story lines collapsing under the weight of each other.Tyrion rocked this episode (as usual). From his threats to Varys declaring he won't be manipulated, to his removing of Janos as leader of the City Watch (I cheered for him after Janos had made insulting comments towards him) and promoting of Bronn which (quite funny) to his conversation with Cerser. Here we realise it was Joffery who ordered last episode's killings, and we see Cersei realising more and more that she has created a monster of a King.It was great seeing the Night's Watch storyline making its way to King's Landing too. Tyrion seems to be more understanding of their situation, while everyone else is still in denial. I'm looking forward to when the White Walkers finally come to the kingdom's, and seeing how all these people who have laughed at such creatures will react.The Arya crew was also part of this weeks highlights. Yoren kicked ass in the beginning, and I'm glad as I've loved this character from the beginning. The relationship between Arya and Genji was very convincing, I think and hope they become very close over the season.Lack of Daenerys was annoying this week. Last week we see little of her too, but afterwards I felt it helped emphasise the feelings of isolation and hopelessness that her people feel. Now however it was a disappointment. Her scene was still great though.The Iron Islands makes an appearance, and they do look very good from what we see. Theon has been one of my least favourite characters on the show, partly because of the actor who I don't think has a great performance, so this whole section was less interesting than the rest of the episode. However his sister has me very interested, and I'm anxious to see her play a very strong role in the show. And yes her introduction was very creepy but I never felt uncomfortable, was quite humours.Beyond the wall, Sam was great this episode. His innocence and child- like qualities made me really want him to 'get the girl' as they say. Jon Snow appeared much harder and tougher, after his encounter with Craster and Mormont last week. Till this point I'd just assumed the male babies were killed, as the show hints at, but in the final scene we get another sighting of the White Walkers!!!. This is great as they are very cool and intriguing, and especially since we haven't seen them since the very first scene of the show, making the ending a great way to finish the episode off.And in Dragonstone, Davos continues to be a very interesting character and I wanna know more about who he is and his relationship with Stannis. Melisandre seems to be making progress in controlling Stannis, I'm interested into seeing how this plays out but so far it hasn't caught my attention too much. Catalyn and her journey to see Renly was also missed. Renly has always been one of my favourites, so I was really hoping to see more of him here.Another strong episode overall. A few story lines yet to have me hooked and some scenes were dearly missed, but a lot of strong content. 8/10!PS: This is my first IMDb review so my writing might be a bit messy. \uf04a",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 2 started off great with the previous two episodes. \"What is Dead May Never Die\" is even better than both and is from personal opinion one of the best of the season. Like \"The Night Lands\", there is a lot of exposition while not introducing us to as many characters as \"The North Remembers\", a good move with a lot of storytelling and characterisation (especially with Tyrion) being even richer. It is just as moody as before, if not as dark, and is even more intriguing, and doesn't have anything superfluous this time round.Visually, \"What is Dead May Never Die\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"What is Dead May Never Die\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.\"What is Dead May Never Die's\" directing is superb, a contender in this particular regard for the \"Baelor\" of Season 2. The acting can't be faulted either, with Peter Dinklage managing to be even more brilliant as Tyrion as he already was. Maisie Williams is up to his level, as are Natalie Dormer and Gwendoline Christie.Overall, fantastic episode and has seen the second season getting stronger rather than dying in one of its best episodes. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Tyrion's political manoeuvering in King's Landing is outstanding and an example of the show at its smartest, and new players like Margery and Brienne grab the attention from the outset.",

When the captors ask to the prisoners who Gendry is, Arya points out to Lommy that had stolen Gendry's helm.\"What Is Dead May Never Die\" is an episode that shows that the imp Tyrion is a cunning Hand of the King. The homosexual Renly is pressed by his wife to have a baby. Theon seems to have betrayed Robb and the Stark House. However there are excessive unnecessary graphic sex scenes. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"What Is Dead May Never Die\"",

That is the last we see from North of the Wall as the action moves south to King's Landing where Tyrion is scheming to discover who he can trust and who would betray him to his sister\u0085 the idea of telling the same secret to several people and waiting to see which gets out is an old way of finding who one can trust but it is still effective and worked well within the story. Elsewhere Bran is continuing to have strange dreams, his mother is trying to form an alliance with King Renly Baratheon and Theon learns his father is planning to attack the north; he will have to decide where his loyalties now lie. Finally Arya and Gendry are captured but their captors don't realise who they have caught.This was a fine episode with plenty of plot advancement and a reasonable amount of action; some of it bloody. As is often the case Peter Dinklage manages to dominate every scene he is in and given the high quality of the other actors present that is saying something. It helps that Tyrion is one of the series' best characters; intelligent and witty without obvious cruelty so that even when he is having somebody thrown in the dungeons he is likable. Maisie Williams was also great as Arya, another of the series more likable characters. As well as established characters this episode sees the introduction of Brienne of Tarth; a formidable warrior-woman who was brilliantly introduced in a scene where she is seen fighting in full armour\u0085 I'm sure most viewers would have thought she was a man right up until she takes off her helmet! The scenes involving Theon might not be full of action but they are potentially some of the most important of the episode as he decides who he is really loyal to. Some may be disappointed that we don't get to see anything of what is happening to Daenerys this episode but omitting her (and other protagonists) did mean we weren't following too many plot strands simultaneously. Overall a solid episode; possibly the best of the second season to date.",

                    "content": "Tyrion, unlike Ned Stark, sees the need to \"test\" the small counsel so that he can determine who is a spy among him that would be detrimental to him. Ultimately it is Grand Maester Pycelle who turns out to be Cersei's eyes and ears (and mouth when needing to relinquish the goods), sent by Tyrion to the dungeon for his \"betrayal\". The news was that Cersei's daughter was to be sent away \"as protection\", not sitting well with the Queen Regent. Littlefinger isn't happy about being lied to by Tyrion (told that Myrcella, Cersei's daughter, would be wed to Robin Arryn), although a mission to convince his long-term crush, Catelyn, to let Jaime go does lessen the blow somewhat. Myrcella being sent to the House Martell as a means of alliance might not sit well with Cersei but what's done is done. All of this further establishes Acting Hand Tyrion hasn't been shy about ruffling feathers and provoking anger among those within King's Landing, especially Cersei. With Jon Snow seeing Caster sacrificing another son to \"it\", he provoked him to such anger that the Night Watch was no longer allowed to stay at the Keep. Lord Commander, upset with Snow, nonetheless must admit that he knew of Caster's cruelty, recognizing it as a necessary alliance despite his scruples. Samwell wants Gilly to accept something of his mother's, while she does so reluctantly as the two departs: Samwell involving a reluctant Jon Snow with what's going on in Caster's Keep has its consequences for sure, but this does further convey Jon's integrity. While I'm not all that wild and crazy about anything Theon Greyjoy, this episode continues his separation from the mission he had started out when returning home to the Iron Islands. Theon almost sends Robb a letter even, but decides not to, instead dedicating himself to his father, Balon, taking the water \"baptism\" in service of their god. Yara will be given most of the ships while Theon must prove himself...in the most effective moment, to me, is Theon questioning Balon's ridicule of him when it was his father who sold him off as a boy to the Starks. With yet another war on the horizon, Balon and his men planning to attack for control of the North, everything just gets more complicated in Westeros. Bran and his dreams, remaining the Stark \"in charge\" of Winterfell, in a discussion with Maester Luwin about \"magic\" does give us a moment of quality time between them as they continue their \"studies\". With Cat meeting up with Renly Baratheon and Robb still off fighting in the name of his father and total control of Wintefell and its segregation, Bran is given his own duties despite still being quite young and unprepared for such. Renly's marriage to Margaery remains such a rather shaky affair due to his homosexual relationship with her brother, Loras. Renly and Margaery setting aside the sexual orientation in favor of securing a pregnancy so the Baratheons and Tyrells are united to eventually go up against the Lannisters remains an obstacle. Cat recognizes that Renly carries the appearances of a King Baratheon but reminds him that his army, while impressively large, will need to be battle tested if ever a threat to the Lannisters. So with all the forces building, as Westeros appears to be a boiling pot where alliances are best for victory, who joins who seems to be how the scales will tip in favor of or against the Lannisters. Arya can't escape the nightmares of the past, as Yoren, leading her and the others among his company to the Night's Watch, tells her of the death of his brother. Yoren speaks of the one who killed his brother, always remembering his face and features (and how he killed him eventually). But not long after the Gold Cloaks return still looking for Gendry. A skirmish led by Yoren, which would obviously end in defeat due to the strength in numbers, leads to Arya losing her sword to a heelish guard named Polliver. Polliver using it on a kid that Arya often chatted with due to being leg-wounded gives Arya the chance to claim he was Gendry, a clever bit of in-the-moment quick-thinking. Arya, in order to survive despite the odds against her, will have to continue to use her wits and have a bit of luck as well. Letting out Jaqen H'ghar from a cage holding him during the skirmish could very well be a decision to serve her positively in the future.",

I loved the themes of betrayal and cunning stealth. Peter Dinklage steals the show as the Hand of the King who uses his cleverness to prove loyalty to him. There is a good amount of action, especially when it comes to the end of the episode. The episode may be free of Vaenarys, but this is still an engaging episode.In this episode, \"What Is Dead May Never Die,\" Tyrion wants to prove the loyalty of the council, so he decides to test them. Theon Greyjoy is given a command of a ship as they decide to attack the North while Robb's forces are at war. Tyrion wants his new girlfriend, Shae to become a handmaiden of Sansa's. Bran is having his dreams, but he comes to realize they may be visions. Jon Snow is reprimanded after his encounter with Craster. Catelyn Stark meets with Renly Baratheon to see if he would join Robb's forces. Finally, Arya is taken captive. Overall, this is an outstanding episode in part to Peter Dinklage's amazing performance as Tyrion. The main reason to watch is just to see him outfox his council foes. But I found the other story lines to be actively engaging which makes this a very strong episode. My Grade: A+",

At Renly's camp we are introduced to new characters \"the Maid of Tarth\", Brienne (Gwendoline Christie) and Margaery Tyrell (Natalie Dormer)There is no Danaerys or Stannis in this episode. The centerpiece of this episode, the thing that gives it its title, is Theon's story takes up a lot of time in this episode. (Alfie Allen's performance is excellent) another character Im taking to is Varys (Conleth Hill is perfect. Varys comes to life whenever he speaks). Tyrion's ruse to find out which of the three members of the small council was likeliest to be Cersei's spy is one of my favourite scenes of the season so far. I have often spoke of my admiration of Peter Dinklage, he is superb.And another favourite of the season do far is the final scenes of the episode with Yoren (Francis Magee is great) telling the tale of his murderous prayer to Arya.",

                    "content": "Instantly continuing where we left off, \"What Is Dead May Never Die\" is calming the audience after a what I thought to be supremely ominous cliffhanger in the previous episode. Jon Snow is alright and Samwell gets to have his romantic moment. Sort of. Meanwhile, we have Catelyn starting her negotiations with the charismatic gay king Renly, a character that I'm very pleased to see again, Tyrion proving that he is a really smart cookie, and Theon having to decide which side of his two families he's on. And last but not least, there is a small but powerful battle scene at the end of the episode involving Arya.What stands out in this episode is clearly the way Tyrion, the new Hand of the King, detects Cersei's snitch \u2013 a method thoroughly entertaining to watch if you haven't read the books. Even if so, I'm sure you'll find pleasure in watching Peter Dinklage outshine everyone in the same room with him. I, however, found some flaws in Sansa encountering Shae for the first time, a scene that obviously needed more takes, in my humble opinion. Another con was Theon confronting his father, which didn't felt genuine and quite nondescript to watch. I simply dislike the whole idea of him coming back to Pyke and none of the scenes until this point as well as none of the scenes in the next two episodes (I've already seen them) made change my opinion about that.In the end, those two things didn't bother me a lot because as usual, the good stuff was predominant and I had great fun with the introduction of Margaery Tyrell in particular. Natalie Dormer is an utterly talented young actress who manages to keep her character interesting not only in a sexual sense (she's still hot, though). Gwendoline Christie does a fine job as Brienne of Tarth yet I have the same issue as with the Theon story part: I don't like the original idea by George R. R. Martin. The other returning cast members, Gethin Anthony and Finn Jones, sustain their good performances from season one while still keeping their relationship juicy. Altogether, this makes for some entertaining 50 minutes filled with the usual good acting, pretty set design, well-written dialogs, great score, and a final scene just as enthralling as the ones in the first two episodes.",

                    "content": "So there was no Daenerys this week nor was there Robb Stark or Joffery. While these characters were left out this episode, it was still a great episode. The storyline has continued to move forward at an incredible pace. Again, complements to the writers for suppressing a thousand page book into a single season.The episode begins where it left off. Jon Snow is brought to the Lord Commander of the Night's watch after snooping around his host's business. When Jon tells the Commander about what he is doing to the children, Jon realizes that he already knew. It turns out that wildlings serve other Gods as well and have to do with sacrificing sons as apart of some ritual. While Jon nor the Lord Commander couldn't figure out what the beast was, we were able to figure out that it was the White Walkers who were receiving the babies.Meanwhile, Theon is at a cross roads. Still at his homeland Pyke, he is trying to figure out who to help: Robb Stark and his war against the Lannisters or his father who has just declared war on the Starks. It was interesting to see how Theon's mind was so split on the idea of going against the family he was born with and the family who raised him. In the end, Theon writes out a warning note to Robb but then immediately sets it on fire to signify that he will stay with his father and sister. So this another plot twist in this episode that will become major as the season continues.Back in King's Landing, Tyrion continues to have his \"fun\" as Hand of the King. It is quite clear from the get go, Tyrion is far more intelligent than Ned as the King's Hand. In this episode he was telling Littlefinger, Varys, and Grand Maester what his plans are for the princess to get her out of the capital before the war arrives. However, he tells each person a different location he wishes to put the princess. Later in the episode, Queen Cersei comes up to him and yells at him for sending the princess off to a certain location. While he had no intention of going about his plan, he was able to find the Queen's rat: the Grand Maester. During the interrogation, Tyrion is told that the Grand Maester went against Jon Arryn (the hand of the king before Ned Stark) and might have poisoned him to keeps his secrets safe.While the trickery was great, the scene between Varys and Tyrion was very well done. The discussion was about where power resides. Not only was the dialog fluent and easy to comprehend, it was great to show that Kings sometimes don't hold all the power but the people who fight for him. Fantastic dialog and scene.Also in this episode, Catelyn Stark arrives at the camp of Renly who has declared himself King. We also see Brienne of Tarth, a great character, but more on her in later reviews. Catelyn asks for Renly's allegiance with Robb. Though we don't quite get an answer, we do know that Renly plans on attacking King's Landing with his 100,000 men at his back.The ending was probably the most suspenseful part of the episode. Arya and Yoren are talking about the day Ned was killed which led to someone attacking their camp. However, it was the Gold Cloaks (army from King's Landing) that attacked but Red Coats under the control of Tywin Lannister, the actual Hand of the King. Of course, a battle broke out and it was graphic and emotional that led to the death of Yoren. The real bad news is that Gendrick (Robert's bastard son) and Arya are now under Lannister forces.Again . . . a lot of story was told this episode. Having said that, it was still a great episode. The real entertainment comes from the twists and turns that the story unfolds to the viewers with the nudity and violence being extra. \"Game of Thrones\" has become a great series to watch. It's dialog driven; something that is somewhat rare for the fantasy genre. This was yet another great episode to watch.Now if you are loving this season so far . . . from a person who has read the second book this season is based on, you haven't seen anything yet.9.1/10",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Garden of Bones\" is one of the best episodes of 'Game of Thrones' up to this point, or at least to me it is. It is the most violent episode up to this still early point of the show, and one of the show's most violent overall. This wasn't a problem with me, though it is understandable why others have objected, to me it didn't seem excessive or gratuitous being important for showing Joffrey's increasingly dark side. The somewhat \"what the heck\" ending may confound viewers understandably but it was interesting and does fuel interest in how the magic would be dealt with.On top of this, \"Garden of Bones\" also has a lot going on in the story and has a lot of characterisation going on. The good news is that it's all interesting and important, nothing is superfluous here with Quarth's introduction being one of the episode's highlights. As well as being the most violent episode up to this point, it's also the darkest and bleakest and is tied with \"Baelor\" as the most emotionally powerful.Visually, \"Garden of Bones\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Garden of Bones\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Standout moments are Sansa's humiliation (hard to watch but brings tears to the eyes), Cat receiving her husband's bones and the Tyrion and Lancel confrontation. Joffrey's dark side is chilling.The direction is superb, one of the episode's best directed episodes, as is the acting. The meatiest material belongs to Peter Dinklage, Richard Madden, Jack Gleeson and Michelle Fairley and it shows in their performances. Dinklage continues to show why he is a show favourite, one would be here all night describing his brilliance. Fairley is very moving, likewise with Sophie Turner.Gleeson sends chills up the spine as an irredeemably evil character (it's not just his actions that make him so, it's also that one doesn't expect a character as young as him to commit the actions he does). Madden is very authoritative.In conclusion, a dark and disturbing episode but also a brilliant one. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

We are experiencing these things in our present world. This is a marvelous series with great implications for bringing about a reign over all the different kingdoms. When there is battle, face to face, in a time of weaponry that is so primitive, there is going to be gore. But the scene with the two courtesans and Joffrey goes beyond the point of exposition. Then there are the tortures of the men with rats, even though they have no real information. Joffrey would have had his future queen ravaged by his soldiers for his own pleasure, telling them to spare her face. Do we need any more extravagances of violence? There are, however, interesting plot lines, including the facing off of brother, Tyrion continuing to bate the king, the motive of revenge for Arya. The arrival of the horse people to the golden city and their nearly gambling their lives away on principle. Then we have the final scene which is about as eerie and unexpected as anything so far.",

Arya Stark is imprisoned in a stable of an old castle with Gendry and Hot Pie, and they witness the torture and death of prisoners by sadistic torturers. Gendry is chosen to be tortured, but Lord Twyn Lannister arrives and interrupts the torture and assigns Arya for the kitchen. After acknowledging that Robb has defeated the Lannister army, Joffrey tortures Sansa with a crossbow and then he orders Meryn Trant to beat and strip her in front of the court. Tyrion arrives and stops the mistreating of Sansa. Littlefinger arrives at Renly's camp to avoid him to go to King's Landing but is not well succeeded. Then he delivers Ned's bones to Catelyn and proposes to exchange Arya and Sansa per Jaime. There is a meeting between Stannis and Renly but they do not have an agreement. Daenery and her group go to the City of Qarth and The Thirteen in principle do not welcome her. Davos brings Melisandre to the shore and the witch delivers a creature made of shadow. \"Garden of Bones\" has four great moments. The first is the wise attitudes taken by Tyrion. The second one is the witty dialog between Arya and Lord Twyn at the table. The third is the impressive attitude of royalty of Daenerys towards The Thirteen. And last but not the least, the foggy shadow creature that the witch gets birth. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Garden of Bones\"",

This puts his sister Sansa in grave danger; Joffrey orders her stripped and beaten but luckily for her Tyrion intervenes and saves her\u0085 while also giving his nephew some words of advice. Tyrion wonders if Joffrey needs some 'female company' so sends a pair of prostitutes to his bed chamber. This just leads to Joffrey ordering one to severely beat the other; both to send a message to Tyrion and to satisfy his own sadistic urges.Away from the capital Arya finds herself captive at Harrenhal; a dangerous place where a prisoner is brutally killed each day\u0085 leading her to add more names to her 'little list'. Luckily the danger ends when Tywin Lannister arrives and orders that the prisoners should be put to work rather than killed\u0085 he also sees that Arya is a girl and orders that she must become his cup bearer; a safer position so long as her identity remains secret. At Renly Baratheon's camp Lord Baelish pays a visit; something Catelyn Stark is not pleased about; although he does later give her Ned's remains. Renly also meets his brother Stannis; each claims to be the rightful king but it remains to be seen what will happen between then; Renly has more men but Stannis has Melisandre. Across the narrow sea Daenerys and her people seek shelter and sustenance in the city of Qarth but it is far from certain that they will even get through the city gates.This was another really good episode; Joffrey has always been the series' most despicable character and here he is at his worst; first when he orders Sansa be abused and then what he does to the two prostitutes; this was a distinctly disturbing scene. Jack Gleeson does a great job making us believe that Joffrey is truly vile rather than a mere pantomime villain. As always Peter Dinklage is brilliant as Tyrion; especially in the scenes where he saves Sansa and then when he blackmails Lancel Lannister into reporting on the queen's activities. There are often fairly brutal scenes in this series but this episode features some of the most disturbing thanks to its sadistic nature; notable the aforementioned scene featuring Joffrey and the prostitutes and later a scene where a prisoner at Harrenhal is killed in a way that involves a rat\u0085 these scenes don't feel gratuitous though as they emphasise the unpleasantness of certain characters and aren't fun to watch. These scenes of brutality aren't the only disturbing moments; the final scene where Melisandre 'gives birth' was certainly nightmare fuel\u0085 what happens next will be interesting to see.",

There is nothing \"big\" that goes on around here, but each storyline is once again, clever and engaging. We get great acting again as Peter Dinklage continues on his roll of magnificent performances as Lord Tyrion. We also get to see some barbaric cruelty from King Joffrey, with a very similar feel to a pornographic video. But that is a powerful scene to witness. In this episode, \"Garden of Bones,\" Robb Stark defeats Lannister forces and he meets a nurse named Talia. Tyrion puts a stop to his nephew's cruelty against Sansa. Vaenarys is introduced to the desert city of Quarth. Arya is imprisoned in Harrahall where she eventually meets Lord Tywin. Catelyn wants to unite Renly and Stannis, but that proves harder than thought. Finally, Lord Baelish visits with Renly who makes a promise to keep her daughters safe, but in return for Ser Jaime. Overall, this is a rather entertaining episode that has a lot going on. But I'm happy to report that each storyline is equally impressive. I loved the introduction to Quarth, the oasis city in the middle of nowhere. Just seeing the gates open brought chills down my spine. A very fun episode. My Grade: A",

Davos goes on a mission with Melisandre. The episode starts with Joffery having Sansa beating as punishment for Robb's victories. There is a great scene when a disgusted Tyrion arrives and sees what happening. The acting is superb all round Jack Gleason has an excellent episode as the cruel king (God I hate Joffery) Sophie Turner is brilliant as poor Sansa, Again my love for Peter Dinklage continues, he is just outstanding. Rory McCann as The Hound doesn't do much, but his silent anger and disgust at Joffery is evident. But a stand out performer and quickly becoming a favourite of mine is Jerome Flynn as Bronn, he delivery of one of his lines had me laughing out loud. As I've already said along with Dinklage as Tyrion, I'm also a fan of Maisie Williams as Arya. There is a lot of Arya in this episode, which I like. After being missing from the last episode Danaerys is back and she has looked a lot better. Davos is given an assignment that sits poorly with the honourable seadog and the episode ends with a very creepy scene.",

                    "content": "When you find two new locations in the opening credits of a Game of Thrones episode, you know it's going to be an important one. And it is, indeed. Major events include the confrontation between the fraternal kings Renly and Stannis, Peter Baelish showing up at Renly's camps to persuade both him and Catelyn Stark, Daenerys and her Khalasar finding an accommodation at last, Arya doing so as well, however, in a less pleasant way, Robb Stark and his army again defeating the Lannister ones, and King Joffrey demonstrating malice that goes way beyond normality.And let's start with talking about that scene in particular. It involves sexual humiliation and violence that left me awestruck while also questioning its necessity. A scene like that never occurred in the original novels and I believe the series would've also been better off without it. Not only because it's utterly unappealing to watch, but also because I just don't buy Joffrey being that evil. It's not normal and we've already had his cruelty depicted numerous times before, so why include it? If I'd like to see a pornographic actress (she is one, look it up) have her derri\u00e8re beaten with a belt, there are other movies to watch. Aside from that, Jack Gleeson once again impressed me with his acting qualities.Later on, there's another very sexually explicit moment in \"Garden of Bones\". It's a disturbing, puzzling, and jaw-dropping cliffhanger as unexpected as it gets. And while this one was in the source material as well, I still don't like it. At first I reckoned this sentiment to be utter confusion about what just happened and so I could prevent writing an overhastily critical review, I decided to watch episode five right afterwards. Yet, it turns out that I still don't like it and what happened in the next episode was actually the most disappointing moment of the whole series yet \u2013 specifics on that in my review for \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\". I'm aware that quite a lot of people seemed to love that scene, but I've watched it twice and my personal conclusion is that it's a form of fantasy Game of Thrones didn't need at all. I didn't have any problems with White Walkers or dragons, but what happened here took me out of the story completely and just didn't feel right.Thankfully, the other story parts of this episode were really good and almost made me forget about the aforementioned two. Best of all, the introduction of Qarth: a walled oasis in the middle of the desert, entitled \"the greatest city that ever was or will be\". The opening of its gates was one of the Game of Thrones' most rememberable moments and revealed a masterpiece of its set designers. The curious folk we're making acquaintance with there is different from everything else in the series, and a sub-plot that hopefully receives its deserved attention in the next couple of episodes. The second new location, Harrenhal, is a far uglier place that serves the sole purpose of capturing, torturing and eventually killing Lannister prisoners. A process that could've been made more entertaining to watch, but I'll stop complaining for once and will say that I enjoyed it a lot. Maisie Williams gives a fantastic turn while a surprise guest voluntarily visits this location.As always, there's also Peter Dinklage, the imp responsible for keeping up HBO's ratings, who amazes with his enormous acting qualities. Receiving far less praise as she should is Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell, making her character wonderfully exciting to watch while having a conversation with Aidan Gillen's Peter Baelish \u2013 a stand-out moment in the episode's screenplay.That makes for an episode that disappointed me at times, but was also rememberable and enthralling on other occasions. Minor flaws just can't curb my amazement for this series.",

Some mindless torturing and killing that isn't really explained, but it works out for Arya as the patriarch of the Lannister's knows right from the beginning that she is a girl and makes her his servant. Maybe they will get close enough that Arya can tell her what Joffrey did to her father, and he can realized how terrible of a king he is, and how his daughter is an incest-driven psychopath. Speaking of Lannister's, the only one worth anything, Tyrion obviously, has done really well to control the and command a large part of the capital without many people realizing it, especially his sister or the inbred rat king.Littlefinger was way to horny to think straight and even got shut down when he tried to manipulate his way out of it. Happens to the best of us. And I was a little surprised that the weird, red, religious freak was already full term, then I remembered that dragon-wizard-drogo baby developed pretty quickly as well. Much like what could have been with him, little red riding hood actually gave birth to Satan, who would actually be quite useful in battle up to this point.",

                    "content": "\"Garden of Bones\", while showed a lot of story, showed more violence this time around. Having said that, I am very glad it turned out that way. Throughout this season so far we have seen a couple of violent scenes. This episode showed more torture than actual sword on sword violence but it was very well done.The episode begins with Robb (The King in the North) winning another battle against the Lannister forces. After the battle, he helps a woman saw a prisoner's leg off because it has become infected. While it was her job, you could see that Robb felt sympathy for the woman and even thanked her for being at the battle. The woman didn't respond likely to Robb but it was nice to see Rob being normal again with the female doctor.It doesn't take too long to show how King Joffery is taking his defeats against Robb. He brings Sansa to the throne room and wields a crossbow as he watches Sansa's clothes being torn off as her \"punishment\" for her brother's treason. Thankfully, Tyrion comes in and saves Sansa from more suffering. The madness of Joffery doesn't end there as the next scene involves him and two prostitutes in his chambers. Even though it was a gift from Tyrion to celebrate his past name day, Joffery orders one of the prostitutes to beat the other prostitute with his belt and then with an unlit torch (or so it looks like). I'm unsure if it was Joffery getting back at Tyrion for embarrassing him in the throne room or he just gets aroused from beating people . . . with objects that is.Also in this episode, we finally see Daenery's continue her march into a city of Qarth. While at first they are reluctant to let her in when she doesn't reveal her dragons, one of the Twelves (the leaders of the city) allows her in as long as they don't do anything that could get them into trouble. So hopefully next episode, her story will finally progress.Back in Westeros, Stannis and Renly Baratheon finally meet. From the start of their conversation, you can see that they have grown apart. Renly makes jokes and even tells his brother that no one wants him for their King. In the end, Stannis gives his brother the night to reconsider or else he will be destroyed. While it was a brief meeting, one can tell that this clash of the brothers will not end well.At Renly's camp, Littlefinger enters Catelyn's tent and asks for a trade: Sansa and Arya for Jamie (Kingslayer) - even though he doesn't have Arya in King's Landing. After Cat draws a knife on Littlefinger, he gives her Ned's bones as a gift. Cat does not agree to the terms.Also in this episode, Arya enters Harrenhal under the control of Tywin Lannister. At first, the prisoners are being tortured for information about the Brotherhood (who appear next season/book) and other things.The ending is where we see \"Game of Thrones\" enter a new area. Melisandre, Stannis' priest, is brought to a dark cave with Davos (Stannis' trusty companion) and she gives birth to a shadow creature. This symbolizes that this show is now showing magic in their episodes - prepare for more of that to come.I hate writing these reviews - they are so damn long. Having said that, I loved this episode. While we didn't see Jon Snow or Theon in this episode, the other characters were exceptional. We are nearly halfway through this season . . . and the best is yet to come. Prepare for a couple of surprises next episode.9.3/10",

But this season the air is very different. The good story is sacrificed to the shock effect. This episode we had to watch ten minutes of torture. Not gory, but still, was it necessary? Game of Thrones got us with its witty dialogue and well drawn characters and its story, not with this kind of tricks. Creating emotions with torture and sadism belongs to cheaper productions who can't create emotional reactions through its story. I don't want to be left feeling dark and disgusted after each episode, I want to be left feeling the satisfaction of watching a great adventure crafted with art, just as I felt after the season 1 episodes.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Ghost of Harrenhal\" is another excellent episode, if not quite one of the best. My only complaint is, like other critics criticising the scene, the treatment of Renly. It just seemed so out of nowhere and rushed, judging from the aftermath too what should have been shocking came over as indifferent.Everything else is brilliant though. Standout scenes were two. One was the exchange between Arya and Tywin, which is very powerfully written and acted with one of the cast's most experienced and charismatic actors in Charles Dance being matched by a younger and less prolific one in Maisie Williams. The other is Brienne and Catelyn's pledge, with superlatively powerhouse performances from Gwendoline Christie and Michelle Fairley.Visually, \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. A standout is the dragon, which actually looks real. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence which is truly remarkable for so much going on in narrative and characterisation, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Charles Dance, Maisie Williams, Gwendoline Christie and Michelle Fairley in particular are just superb here, they consistently were in 'Game of Thrones' but all four give some of their best work. In summary, excellent. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

She must think this over because she is warned that this would make her beholden to these people. Things are ready to boil. However, I am concerned about that shadow man because it injects an element of the supernatural that even in a fantasy story, kind of breaks the rule. At least the dragons are a part of the established world and known of from the beginning.",

Daenerys is welcomed in Qarth and Xaro proposes to marry her and help her to retrieve the Iron Throne. \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\" shows the weird shadow creature and how dangerous the witch Melisandre is. The smart Arya is doing well working for Tywin Lannister and now she has the chance to eliminate three enemies. Daenerys may be in danger in the mysterious Qarth, but she has a good adviser protecting her. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\"",

He doesn't get chance though as a strange creature, like a man made of smoke, appears and kills Renly before vanishing just as quickly. Catelyn tells his guard, Brienne of Tarth, to leave with her as she is accused of the killing.Back in King's Landing Tyrion Lannister learns some details of his mother's plans; she has been ordering the manufacture of wildfire; a liquid that burns like dragons' breath. Joffrey intends to catapult it onto any invading fleet; an idea scoffed at by Bronn who states that is a good recipe for burning down the capital.Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys' and her people have been allowed to enter the great city of Qarth and people are taking an interest in her, and her dragons. Some are sinister while others are almost seductive; Xaro Xhoan Daxos offers her half the content of his vault and the Iron Throne\u0085 if she marries him; something Jorah Mormont counsels against.Elsewhere Arya who is now serving as cupbearer to Tywin Lannister learns that she is owed three favours; because she saved the lives of Jaqen H'ghar and his two companions they will take three lives for her\u0085 any three lives. North of the wall the Night Watch are approaching Mance Rayder's Wildlings and Jon Snow asks to be allowed to join the small raiding party that is to attack them.As is usual this episode contains multiple story lines and us usual we spend just the right amount of time in each location. The opening scene came as quite a shock even though we'd seen the birth of the 'smoke man' at the end of the previous episode. The special effects were impressive but not overused; once the creature has slain Renly it vanishes leaving Brienne to face those who rush to the scene; while the character isn't the most talkative Gwendoline Christie does a fine job in the role. It isn't a surprise that Peter Dinklage continues to impress as Tyrion Lannister; he is ably supported in most of his scenes by Jerome Flynn who plays his bodyguard Bronn. The scene between Maisie Williams and Charles Dance, as Arya and Tywin Lannister, is notable in that little happens but there is the feeling that Arya could be exposed at any moment\u0085 it was great how the younger actress could hold her own against the older, well established, actor who was also on top form. While not much happens in the scenes north of the wall that doesn't mean they are boring; they show us just how bleak it is up there and tell us more about the as yet unseen Mance Rayder. Likewise the scenes in Qarth are more about hinting at what is to come\u0085 what is in the wealthy Xaro's famed vault and who is the sinister character who approached Daenerys at the reception. Overall another fine episode that hints at interesting things to come.",

In Harrenhal, Arya receives a special promise from Jaqen H'ghar, one of three prisoners she saved from the Gold Cloaks. Special praise for this episode must go to Maisie Williams, I have been vocal about my praise for her, and now she ups the game and is even more brilliant in her scene with Charles Dance. Both are superb. She also shares a brilliant scene with Jaqen H'ghar, the brilliant Tom Wlaschiha. I hope we get to see a lot more of him, given his promise to Arya it looks like we will.",

There are some smart moments in the relationships, but some of the dialog didn't as engage me as I hoped. Also, while the story's still good and the writing's fine, very little happens and it left wanting to see what would happen next.Anyway, like I said, the story's still good and the script is well-written. The performances are still great from all involved, the pacing is still good, the direction is solid, and the music score continues to shine. So, overall, not nearly as great as I hoped, but another good episode for this season.",

                    "content": "Sure, Tywin Lannister's conversation with Arya Stark, his new cupbearer whose identity he's unaware of, was phenomenal work by the screenwriters and the actors. Agreed, Qarth is just as fabulous in this episode as it was when we got a quick glimpse at it in \"Garden of Bones\". Just as important, the mindblowing landscape shots in Iceland, the setting used for the trek of the Night's Watch. And as always, the debate between Tyrion and Cersei is such fun to watch.But there is another major story part that ruined the whole episode for me: Renly's death. I disliked the ending of the previous episode already, however, the story worsens again and I ended up being more disappointed than at any other occasion in the whole series. It's not that I'm enraged about his character dying, but in my opinion, this was so cheaply done by George R. R. Martin and had me losing my faith in Game of Thrones for a moment. A mythical shadowy creature coming into Renly's tent, killing him, and then disappearing again? Are you kidding me? I couldn't help but laugh at the silliness of this scene and even more so the ones that followed. Brianne pledging fealty to Catelyn somewhere in the woods looked like the beginning of a bad lesbian porno movie, Finn Jones did a terrible job at portraying the emotions of his character after his lover died, and Aidan Gillen bugged me due to him reading his text like a vegetable. Natalie Dormer was very interesting, however, as we unexpectedly got to see a new side of her character. Stannis and Davos conversing wasn't especially well-made either and the protracted scene got a bit boring. Same goes for little schoolboy Theon getting repeatedly bullied by his pals, his sis, and his daddy \u2013 lame! But then, the pros of \"The Ghost of Harrenhal\" made it worth my while after all, even though it took some time to get them. During the episode's first 20 minutes, we were presented an assemblage of everything I disliked about it and the quality only slowly improved after that. Near the end, though, we got Jaqen H'ghar defeating Tyrion in terms of awesomeness, while the very token imp was busy discovering a huge secret Cersei tried to hide from him. Informant for that was, by the way, the prettiest girl in King's Landing: Lancel Lannister. What made me fell in love with at least the second half of this episode were the scenes at Qarth. The rich independent city somewhere in the complete desert gives us some of the coolest character introductions of the whole season and one of television's most beautiful settings with its market place. Additionally, Khaleesi Daenerys finally gets to be pretty again and, as we've seen in parts of season one, her impersonator, Emilia Clarke, is extraordinarily talented at that as long as she isn't stranded in the dirt without anything to eat. Now, how profound are the scenes I disliked in my rating? It adds up to the worst rating I've ever gave a Game of Thrones episode, yet the looming war makes me stay positive about the series' and this season's future.",

However the ghost of Harrenhal proves that wrong - covering every storyline except Robb and Jaime's and greatly pushing the plot forward. The Jaqen three death scenes were fantastic, as were the Tyrion kings landing scenes. The only problems i can find with it is that Renly's death was not as shocking as in the books and the tickler died instead of wheeze - cutting out his awesome death scene in book 3. This is tiny nit picking though. The story was exciting, the politics was interesting and the hints of what is to come make as always the wait to next week excruciating. Again the acting was absolutely phenomenal from everyone involved. The gold stars go this week to Jerome Flynn, Tom Wlaschiha and Gwendoline Christie as Bronn, Jaqen and Brienne who all seem like they've made the characters literally jump out of the book into reality. The stage has been set up for everything to kick-off in the second half of the season. An exciting end to the first half to the second season!",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Old Gods and the New\" is one of the best episodes of 'Game of Thrones' up to this point and along with \"Garden of Bones\" the best episode of Season 2, or at least to me it is. It is a quite different episode and there are many deviations from the book. The heart of the book is still kept, and while the book is just great in its own way the changes here in the episodes were not for the worse. \"The Old Gods and the New\" is a tightly paced, rich in story, development and characterisation, thrilling and emotional episode.There is a huge amount going on in the storytelling and the characterisation and how they're developed. The good news is that, like with \"Garden of Bones\", all interesting and important, nothing is superfluous here. The scenes between Tywin and Arya, the King's Landing Riot and the scene between Tyrion and Joffrey (as chillingly evil as ever) are particularly brilliantly executed scenes.Visually, \"The Old Gods and the New\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Old Gods and the New\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Direction is superb as is, even more so, the acting. Peter Dinklage continues to show why he is a fan favourite, Jack Gleeson sends chills up the scenes and Charles Dance and Maisie Williams act and interact beautifully in their scenes. Concluding, a 'Game of Thrones' high point. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Theon's sudden betrayal and taking of Winterfell is handled in an extraordinary way that makes it difficult to watch, while Arya and Tywin's scenes come to a head and are still beautifully written; they also allow for one of the greatest air-punch moments in the show's entire history, for me (Jaqen comes through again). I wasn't sure about Emilia Clarke's acting in this one, but the riot scenes in King's Landing allow a new hero - the Hound - to shine and are also an example of the show at the top of its game.",

This episode, while not for shrinking violets, gave cause for the acts of its characters, so even if violence was employed, there was a logic to it. This could be one of the best of the episodes because we get inside the psyches of the ambitious and and the survivors. There is more humanity to the people. I've missed some of that. Joffrey and his mother really believe that somehow they have been wronged as Tyrion sees the big picture. Is Danaerys supposed to be a sympathetic character? Her continual demands to take her rightful place get kind of tiresome. I recognize that she is a supernatural being and has those dragons and everything, but when I saw the carnage of her people, it was the way the game seems to be played. Theon is also interesting. He is about as despicable as one can be and seems to be a hollow threat. Like Joffrey, he is impulsive and paranoid. When he is pushed by others he acts for them, not for himself.",

In Qarth, Daenery's guards are murdered and the three dragons are stolen while she is negotiating ships with the Spice King. \"The Old Gods and the New\" shows how cruel and ambitious Theon is, executing Rodrick. Arya is smart, but is risking too much since Twyn is not a fool. Unfortunately the peasants did not kill Joffrey and the court. The bastard Jon Snow is one of the few men with honor in this show.

Theon forces young Bran Stark to yield the town in order to protect his people; the people of Winterfell are not keen to support the treacherous Theon though; especially when he beheads Ser Rodrik Cassel. The only person who seems willing to switch sides is the Wildling Osha\u0085 and trusting her could be a mistake. Back in King's Landing the people let King Joffrey know what they think of him and Sansa is almost killed in the ensuing riot. North of the wall the Night's Watch run into a group of Wildlings and Jon takes one, a woman named Ygritte, prisoner\u0085 he is told he will have to kill her but is unable to do so and she escapes; by the time he catches up with her he has lost contact with his comrades. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys continues to try to acquire ships but nobody wants to help\u0085 and then something terrible happens; what is the 'Mother of Dragons' if she no longer has her dragons?This was another really good episode where loyalties are questioned and many characters are endangered. While the odious Joffrey remains the least likable character in the series Theon is showing that he can be almost as despicable as he seizes Winterfell and kills Rodrik Cassel\u0085 Alfie Allen does a fine job in the role. We also get to see that Wildling women are as tough as most men as both Osha and new character Ygritte show just what they can do; actresses Natalia Tena and Rose Leslie made is believe just how tough these characters were in their different ways. While I'm sure that few people would consider 'Game of Thrones' to be a feminist series it does have a lot of great actresses playing strong roles; others include young Maisie Williams who, as Arya Stark, easily holds her own in her scenes with veteran actor Charles Dance and Emilia Clarke who manages to capture both the toughness and the more vulnerable side of Daenerys. Overall this episode nicely advanced the plot and left me keen to see what happens next.",

Arya keeps running in To trouble and she comes face to face with a surprise visitor; Danaerys vows to take what is hers, whilst Jon Snow is given a chance to prove himself. Roose Bolton brings Robb disturbing news. I didn't think any character in \"Game Of Thrones\" would make me hate them as much as I do Joffery. Step forward Theon, you made the list. What a despicable swine. The high points of the episode feature two of my favourite characters and actors in the show. Tyrion Lannister finally unleashes his rage and anger at his nephew's monstrous cruelty and stupidity. The scene between Dinklage and Jack Gleeson is perfect. Not just because it sees Joffrey slapped. The interplay between the two is superb. And secondly once again Maisie Williams and Charles Dance are excellent in their scenes. I thin it's excellent seeing such a young actress showing so much confidence in performing with a veteran actor. One of the awesome things of Game Of Thrones that I've not yet mentioned is the opening. Whilst showing the map of Westeros, it shows us where we will visit in the episode. Much of Jon Snow's story beyond the Wall is also excellent, this episode introduces us to Ygritte, played by Rose Leslie, and she's excellent in the role. On the downside I'm still not convinced by the scenes with Robb and Talisa. It's not the fault of the actors, both Madden and the gorgeous Chaplin do fine, but the script seems as if it were written with two young 16 year olds. The best line of the show as usual still belongs to Tyrion \"We've had idiot kings, and we've had vicious kings, but I don't know if we've ever been blessed with a vicious idiot before!\"",

                    "content": "It's clearly best to watch \"The Old Gods and the New\" without knowing what to expect from it, so I won't get any specific with the plot and I'll limit myself to saying: it's awesome. The first Game of Thrones episode to be directed by Emmy winner David Nutter (who later went on to direct the undisputable #1 of all GoT episodes \u2013 \"The Rains of Castamere\") is an important turning point in season two, as everything points in the direction of war due to the events in this episode.In the Winterfell story part, things start to go down right from the beginning. And that is actually my problem with it: that it happens right at the beginning. I'm convinced that I'm not alone with the opinion that the breathtaking intensity overshadowed the whole subsequent scene \u2013 which is a well-written argument between Jon Snow and Qhorin Halfhand that should definitely not be overlooked. I'm being extra harsh on this subject and say that this is really bad editing because the Winterfell scene would've worked palpably better if used as the finale of an episode (either this one or the one before it). And while not as huge, the same applies for the King's Landing riots, however in this case, the next scene features Emilia Clarke even more feisty than usual and will gain your attention right away \u2013 even if you can still hear your heart beating as a response to what just happened. But I guess I really can't judge too hard considering the vast amount of things happening, with a lot of them differentiating from the source novel quite a lot. And in this case, I have to say that I enjoyed the version of Benioff and Weiss more than George R. R. Martin's.Besides those two scenes, which genuinely affected me, I had two other favorite moments in \"The Old Gods and the New\": the great suspense that comes up when Lord Baelish visits Tywin Lannister at Harrenhal who, as we know, is not aware of having the youngest Stark daughter as his cupbearer, and what happens beyond the Wall after the aforementioned Jon Snow scene. Introducing Rose Leslie as a new guest cast member, we meet the wildling Ygritte who is able to lift up the show's sex appeal (yeah, that fairly diminished with Brienne of Tarth) even though she has like half a dozen layers of clothes on. The first scene with here features one of this episode's logical goofs, but I connived at that as well since what follows is an icy pursuit that is one of the simplest but also most entertaining action sequences in season two thus far. But topping anything else is the bedtime scene with Jon and Ygritte and what I reckon to be the show's loveliest love story initiates. Not on the same level, but still surprisingly adorable to watch was Robb Stark continuing his flirtation with field nurse Talisa (sex appeal still rising). In the meantime, Jaqen H'ghar climbs higher and higher on the ladder of Game of Thrones' most awesome characters and the climactic situation at Qarth reaches a new apex with a shocking crime. You see? The plot is really fascinating in this one and the small flaws can't ultimately mar the entertainment I had while watching \"The Old Gods and the New\". Outstanding performances by Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen), and newbie Rose Leslie additionally help it to become this season's best episode yet.",

It was frightening, suspenseful, funny and dramatic. \"The Old Gods and the New\" is an achievement.Right from the start, Theon captures Winterfell and orders Bran to yield the castle to him. Now if you remember from last episode, Bran's dream showed the ocean claiming Winterfell. As Theon does a dangerous decapitating a loyal soldier, the rain begins to fall harder and harder symbolizing the ocean Bran was referring to. By the end of the episode, Bran and his son sneak out of Winterfell undetected.North of the Wall, Jon Snow continues his journey with the intent to kill as many wildlings as possible. During his mission, he and his group ambush a wildling campsite and Jon captures Ygritte, a female red head. Ygritte is an important character to this series for Jon Snow so be ready to see a lot of her. And after a failed attempt at executing her, Jon and Ygritte have a rundown. Even though Jon captures her again, he is unable to find his group before nightfall.In Kings Landing, Cersei and Tyrion watch as they force the princess to leave the capital before the war hits. After a little threat from Cersei, King Joffery and the royal family are attacked by the people. Even though Tyrion tries to tell Joffery that this attack is all his fault, Joffery walks away and even lets Sansa to be attacked by three men. The Hound does save her just before she is raped but it will scar her for life that Joffery did not do anything for her.In Harrenhal, Arya continues to be a cup bearer for Tywin. It seemed everything was fine until Littlefinger came in and began to talk to Tywin about Renly's wife and her family. It was intense since Littlefinger knows Arya when she was in King's Landing. It was great to see Arya try to hide her face as she refilled their wine cups and Littlefinger trying to see her face. Later in the episode, Arya steals a message about Robb heading south before Tywin can see the message. Though a red cloak caught her outside his chambers, she goes to Jacquen and tells him to kill the guard immediately. It was a funny scene of dialogue and close calls but the episode did it perfectly.In Qarth, Daenerys tries to find any way to get ships to cross the sea towards Westeros. Unfortunately for her, she has no allies in Westeros and no one gives her the ships when she promises fortunes. At the end of the episode, her dragons are taken from her bedroom.This was a fast paced episode. I was glad when I hit the half way mark because I wanted to see more of the story unfold. Yes, Stannis was left out this week but it didn't matter. His time will come in the later episodes. Still, it was a fantastic episode. Bravo.10/10",

Your hatred for Joffery will reach maximum capacity in this gem, as his cruelty takes hold and completely loses his sight on humanity as terror takes over his persona. People are upset, and they want his \"Royal Highness\" to know about it. Tyrian stands strong as he decides to show true leadership, and courage, way above average for the actual \"King.\" Theon Greyjoy hits rock bottom, and he knows it despite his denial and supposed leadership. We lose a dear friend in Winterfell, A rather graphic but touching scene, \"I will be joining your father soon..\" Greyjoy has some waking up to do, and Robb Stark plans on giving him the rude awakening he deserves. Theon is just a confused, worthless wench, who clearly has daddy issues, and will never meet his fathers expectations no matter what \"accomplishments\" he makes. Dany comes across new obstacles, and demands things that seem impossible to certain rulers, even though she failingly persuades them that her dreams do in fact come true. She is met with disappointment when she returns to her quarters, slaughtered men in her midst, important things riding on the backs of others.All in all, great suspenseful episode making me yearn for more, and read the book much faster.

On the other hand, though, this was the one with the most changes, and really a LOT. It was the first time they came up with many new things and changed the story of a book in quite a few places. The outcome will be the same, but the journey towards it has been altered. Now, I expected this, since the producers probably want to leave their own mark as well, and not only copy the books. And I thought the changes were for the better. I have read the books, and don't mind them as long as they improve the story. The execution of Rodrik showed the pressure Theon has when he took Winterfell and how he took drastic decisions (more coming) which doomed him, and made him lose his last shred of honor. The fact that Dany's dragons were stolen will ,probably, lead to her going to the House of the Undying to get them back. Now, Dany's storyline in the 2nd book kind of bored me. This was a welcome change which definitely adds more tension and interest to her storyline. All in all, a great episode, with a few welcome changes which, I repeat, won't change the outcome but, in this case and from my point of view, make the story a bit faster paced, more emotional and better.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"A Man Without Honour\" continues the consistently high standard of 'Game of Thrones', if not quite one of the best for me. Other previous episodes had scenes that were bigger, bolder and more memorable, something that \"A Man Without Honour\" is slightly lacking in comparison in. Having said that, the episode's quieter tone, meditative pace and that it was more character and interaction driven and more intimate and less focused on action was appreciated.It is the characterisation and the character interaction that makes \"A Man Without Honour\" the great episode that it is and elevates it to a stronger level, although it was already an impeccably well made, written and acted episode. The only missteps are Arya made to look a little foolish and the overlong and not particularly necessary scene between Jaime and Alton. Otherwise, Maisie Williams and Charles Dance act their scenes beautifully, while the Jon Snow/Ygritte and Daenerys moments and the character of Pyat Pree are Season 2 and show-so-far highlights.Visually, \"A Man Without Honour\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"A Man Without Honour\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Direction is superb as is, even more so, the acting with not a single weak link.In summary, more 'Game of Thrones' greatness. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Anya is becoming entertainment for her captor; he is able to speak frankly with him. She is feeling her way out, having thoughts of murder, but she is also respectful of him (to a point). Shadow people kill most of the Thirteen and the Mother of Dragons has only one goal: to get her \"children\" back so she can pursue her quest. There is a great deal to think about, moving into the next episode.",

Jaime kills Alton Lannister in his cell and when Torrhen comes to see, he strangles him and flees. However he is captured and Lord Rickard wants to kill him for the death of his son Torrhen but Catelyn protects Jaime. Jon Snow searches the Night's Watch patrol with Ygritte and she leads him to an ambush. Daenerys finds who had stolen her dragons, as part of a coup d' etat in Qarth. \"A Man without Honor\" should be named \"men without honor\" since not only Jaime, but also the ambitious Theon and Xaro do not have honor. Impressive the scene of the two children's bodies totally burned. What will be the fate of Jon Snow and what will happen do Daenerys are two great questions for the next episode. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"A Man Without Honor\"",

North of the wall Jon Snow's prisoner, Wildling girl Ygritte, is tormenting him with sexual offers she knows will test his vows. Back in the capital Sansa is terrified when she has her first period as it means she will be expected to bear Joffrey's children\u0085 something even Cersei has sympathy for. Across the Narrow Sea in Qarth Daenerys is determined to get her dragons back but those who have stolen them have other plans for them\u0085 and her. Elsewhere Jaime Lannister's life is danger after he kills one of his guards and Tywin Lannister lets Arya know that he suspects she isn't the lowborn girl she is claiming to be.This is another solid episode. It gets off to a fine start; with each passing episode Theon is becoming less likable; Alfie Allen is doing a fine job in the role. While he is becoming less sympathetic the previously despicable Cersei Lannister is showing a softer side as she talks to first Sansa then her brother Tyrion; for once she acknowledges that Joffrey is never going to be a good person. The scenes north of the wall were rather fun; Rose Leslie did a particularly good job as Ygritte as she constantly torments poor Jon Snow. While several plot threads are nicely advanced it is the scenes in Qarth that provide the biggest shock as most of the city's rulers are murdered\u0085 although the final scene in Winterfell is disturbing too. Overall yet another fine episode that again leaves the viewer keen to see what happens next.",

My heart is going out more and more to Sansa - she's now a young woman. Theon hunts down Bran after he escapes - and grows more vile with each episode. Daenerys has her dragons stolen. And some touching moments between Tyrion and his sister Cersei. Really great episode!I have to say that Pyat Pree (and the other wizards like him) look like something out of Star Trek OST.

Jamie shows how far he is willing to go when he meets a relative. Some of the actors give their worst performances of the entire run of the show. Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey Michelle Fairley and Iain Glenn I'm talking to you Sophie Turner is good as Sansa, and she shares a good scene with The Hound. Kit Harrington enjoys some fun scenes with Rose Leslie and as always Maisie Williams is excellent in her scenes with Charles Dance as is Peter Dinklage in his one scene and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau is simply superb as Jamie Lannister.",

Episode 5 and 6 were still good episodes, but they weren't as great as the first four which did a great job continuing where the story lines left off in Season 1. This episode, on the other hand, is an improvement and is another great episode. Sure, some of the new characters had little to do, but it doesn't matter.The acting's still great, the story and script are well-written, the relationships are still great, the moments with Daenerys are good (when she finds out her dragons have been taken, it left a cliffhanger to what would happen in the last three episodes which is very satisfying), the music score's still great and the pacing is fine.Overall, another great episode and looking forward to review the next three episodes. :)",

Theon Greyjoy, newly proclaimed Prince of Winterfell, awakens in his bed- chamber on his own \u2013 without Osha, the wildling whoring herself around the castle last episode. But as we've already seen a glimpse of there, her services were for the purpose of freeing Bran and Rickon Stark from the custody of the one GoT character who presumably received more death wishes than King Joffrey since the last episode, the aforementioned Theon, who now initiates a hunt for the two boys. And our hatred for him becomes bigger and bigger.Meanwhile, wildling Ygritte is giving her captor, Jon Snow, more sex offers than Ros and Shae are giving their johns combined and war is just around the corner in King's Landing (Stannis is only still absent, though. Probably nursing the baby demon his semen produced.) Saying hello as well, in case you forgot about him, is Jaime Lannister who also asserts the audience that he isn't in the field of the sympathetic characters, while detecting who is good and who is bad gets quite fuzzy in Qarth, from now on the bloodiest city that ever was or will be.All of those story parts provide for constantly thrilling entertainment and you really have to look carefully to find flaws with them. The only things I didn't enjoy that much were Arya conversing with Tywin Lannister (why, yes, because Arya acted foolishly stupid and besides the last dialogue sequence about the correct pronunciation of 'my lord', it didn't include much that we haven't already seen from those two), what happened between Jaime and Alton Lannister (too long and actually rather silly), and Shae getting weirdly aggressive once her new BFF Sansa Stark deals with puberty. But those are small events in the whole of a great episode that is equally dramatic, gory, and romantic.Just as in \"The Old Gods and the New\", Jon Snow/Ygritte and Daenerys moments were above anything else, by far. The mysterious disappearing of the Khaleesi's dragons in the last episode leads to a shockingly awesome scene involving Pyat Pree, a warlock that ups his creepiness every single time he's on screen. The mysterious disappearing of Qhorin Halfhand and his Night's Watch fellows (come on, Jon and Ygritte really didn't run away THAT far.) leads to more superbly written bantering between the two left behind. Cersei being fully honest with Tyrion seemed more than just out of place, but nevertheless, the performances of the two actors made it look genuine after all.\"A Man Without Honor\" had some other small gems in it, but without writing that much, I'd name it the second best episode of this season up to this point. The anticipation for the imminent war is killing me and the fantastic cliffhangers (yes, plural) made me watch the next episode right afterwards.",

It made me very confused on if that was who I thought they were or not. Unless the writer wanted to keep it a secret if they were found, captured and killed, then it only left me completely denying the fact that such a main character would have such a meaningless off screen death.Other than that one bit of confusion, great episode once again!",

I love the tidbits that are offered up with The Hound being \"The Hound\" and Shia's devotion for protecting Sansa. All of that is great, but Theon's judgment was one of my favorite moments in the entirety of this show. No matter how many time I watch this episode and that scene it NEVER gets old. The look of Shock and awe on Maester Luwin and even Theon's expression was enough to shink my heart into my stomach. Oh and that fade to black is an amazing cherry on top. There more bloody and gory moments throughout the other episodes, but since the first time I saw this episode my reaction has never changed. This is my ~5th time binge watch this series and...that fade to black!",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.It is agreed that \"The Prince of Winterfell\" is basically an episode setting things up for the Season 2 finale. The good news is that it does it brilliantly, while not quite being one of the best episodes of the season. Like \"A Man Without Honour\", \"The Prince of Winterfell\" is less action-driven and focuses more on the dialogue and the character interaction. It is a fairly subdued and intimate episode and that is in no way a bad thing, due to it handling this approach pretty brilliantly. \"The Prince of Winterfell\" has a few scenes that bring it down somewhat. The Stannis and Davos scene, while acted well, is far too short for the two characters to be memorable let alone shine. More problematic are the overlong and pointless Daenerys and Mormont and Robb and Talisa scenes, compared to the other interactions and scenes they were just not that interesting and didn't come over as relevant to the story.Luckily, many scenes and interactions are incredibly compelling. Brienne and Jaime, Varys and Tyrion, Arya and Jaqen, Tyrion and Joffrey, all brilliantly done. Joffrey and Theon continue to be nasty pieces of work, Joffrey is still the more evil of the two but Theon is coming close to his level with every episode.Visually, \"The Prince of Winterfell\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Prince of Winterfell\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Direction is strong. Even stronger is the acting, with the high points being Maisie Williams and especially Peter Dinklage. Jack Gleeson, Alfie Allen, Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Gwendoline Christie are also high up.Overall, extremely well done. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Joffrey's bravado is disgusting and let's see if he will have the bravery that he shows to the court. Catelyn's betrayal is unforgivable and has deeply affected Robb and the other Lords.

Back in King's Landing Tyrion is preparing for the arrival of Stannis's fleet and is anticipating that they will have to withstand a siege. He also realises just how far his sister will go to show her power; she has Ros beaten thinking that she is the woman Tyrion loves. Elsewhere Arya gives the final name to Jaqen H'ghar, Robb has his mother arrested for releasing Jaime Lannister and Daenerys refuses to leave Qarth without her dragons.This might not have been the most exciting episode; much of it was spent preparing for the battle that will occur when Stannis's fleet arrives in King's Landing. That doesn't mean it wasn't good; there were lots of fine scenes. The scenes between Peter Dinklage and Lena Headey, as Tyrion and Cersei, were impressive as they started in a friendly way but ended with Tyrion promising revenge for what happened to Ros. Dinklage also impressed in a scene between himself and Conleth Hill, as Lord Varys, where they talk about how he enjoys 'The Game' and how he is surprised to find himself in his current position given that his father once put him in charge of the drains! The scene is nicely mirrored by one between Stephen Dillane and Liam Cunningham, as Stannis and Davos Seaworth, where the latter talks of his humble origins. Another highlight was the scene between Maisie Williams and Tom Wlaschiha, as Arya and Jaqen H'ghar; both did a great job with young Maisie Williams really making us believe how her character has become harder over the series. There were no really weak scenes although the scene involving Daenerys just seemed to be there to remind us of her situation. Overall another solid episode that set things up nicely for the Battle of Blackwater Bay.",

                    "content": "\"The Prince of Winterfell\" is a more character-focused episode than any that came before it this season, providing the calm before the storm. Plot in A Paragraph: Arya calls in her final debt with Jaqen in a way that he is not amused with. Robb finds out that Theon is not the only person to go behind his back. At Winterfell, Theon receives a visitor. Tyrion and Varys bond, Danaerys ignores Ser Jorah's advice. Stannis and Davos approach their destination. I really liked Gemma Whelan's performance as Yara and Alfie Allen performs strongly, as he has throughout this second season as Theon.I didn't think Peter Dinklage could improve on his Emmy winning performance of the first season but his amazing turn this season has been ridiculously good, he has several excellent scenes that show his talent as an actor. He shares a brilliantly emotional scene with Shae (Sibel Kekilli) and his scene with Varys (Conleth Hill) is one of my favourites of the season. Hill shines whenever he is in a scene with Dinlklage.Lena Headey's Cersei actually seems to rise to the occasion of being in a scene with him in this episode. Normally he blows her off the screen, I've not disliked her as much as I did in this episode since the beginning of season one. Charles Dance has been excellent as Tywin Lannister, and his scenes with Maisie Williams were always good, but perhaps too much of a good thing as I will miss them now Tywin has left Harrenhal. Their scenes have been some of my favourites of this season. On the negative side the Robb and Talisa story features two very good looking people doing their best with material that is clich\u00e9 through and through. Oona Chaplin has a nice bum though, and I hope we get to see more of it. Lol Emilia Clarke and Michelle Fairely are again weak links acting wise too. Back to the good. I really liked the interplay between Brienne and Jaime as the Maid of Tarth leads her prisoner to a boat. Now bring on episode 9 and the battle of blackwater. What promises to be the biggest of the season.",

                    "content": "\"The Prince of Winterfell\" doesn't include any action scenes at all, but you feel that it serves as the preparation for what happens in the next episode and as that, I found it to do a very good job. However, D.B. Weiss and David Benioff, the creators of the show, don't desist from including outstanding drama moments. Most of those happen in King's Landing where people seem to be in direct preparation for war (the whole setting just looked a little too calm for me considering the looming battle) while Harrenhal also gets its deserved attention. Not really in the fore anymore (rhyme alert!) are the story parts with Jon Snow and Daenerys, but I sense huge surprises waiting for them nevertheless in the final two episodes of season two. Winterfell and the Stark camp receive a fair amount of screen time as well, Stannis and Davos return after a short absence with a rather forgettable conversation that only includes one important sentence in two minutes of talk. Alrighty then, lots of stuff to talk about!Perpetually entertaining, but notably great in this episode were the several scenes at King's Landing, every single one involving Peter Dinklage as Tyrion Lannister. The only Emmy-winning cast member of the show never disappoints with his acting, yet in this episode, I honestly found more joy in the actors sharing the scenes with him. Lena Headey went back to being bitchy, the solitary thing she does better than having sex with her brother. Then there's Jerome Flynn as Bronn, spitting out hilarious one-liners pretty much every time he opens his mouth, Conleth Hill as Varys, whose only job seems to be having interesting conversations with all sorts of royal family members in the city, and Sibel Kekilli as Shae, the German actress who always failed to impress me until this episode and the ones before it, in which she mostly overcomes the unnaturalness she's had until that point.Maisie Williams once again did a terrific job as Arya - her conversation with Jaqen H'ghar may have been the best moment of \"The Prince of Winterfell\" \u2013 but I found the group conversation in Tywin Lannister's dining room to be unnecessarily prolonged. Another scene overstaying its welcome happened in the tent of King Robb. Lady Talisa telling him a story of her childhood was definitely unneeded, yet it resulted in her taking her clothes off, which relativizes my criticism. I mean, as objective as I try to be in my reviews, that girl got a helluva booty. In a completely different matter, Brienne of Tarth got to spend time with Jaime Lannister, arguably the funniest scene this episode had to offer.Rose Leslie didn't lose her charm, only her screen time in this episode while seeing Qhorin Halfhand again made for some nice dialogue. Sam, Grenn, and that other nameless Night's Watch fellow who's never gotten an introduction, but is somehow there since the beginning of this season, use their time to dig comfort stations, during which Sam discovers a rotten Night's Watch cloak. Well, that was thrilling.Across the Narrow Sea, more specifically in Qarth, Daenerys is spending way too much time on whether or not to rescue her stolen dragons from Pyat Pree, thus the one scene there, her discussion with Jorah Mormont, was virtually useless. Now, to finally come to the episode's title, \"The Prince of Winterfell\", there's Theon Greyjoy, the douchebag with daddy issues who recently killed Bran and Rickon. But, why is Isaac Hempstead- Wright's name included in the opening credits, then? An interesting solution comes at the end of the episode.All in all, I enjoyed \"The Prince of Winterfell\" quite a lot and best of all was the way the tension for the following episode was built. Practically every story part in this episode was a set-up for the big season finale starting with \"Blackwater\" and left me wondering about all the things that could possibly happen. Way to go!",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Blackwater\" for me is Season 2 at its finest and is one of the greatest 'Game of Thrones' episodes, containing everything that makes me in love with the show in the first place. In response to my review title, my personal answer is that it is an extremely strong contender. Everything in relation to the battle is truly spectacular, epic in scope, rich in emotional impact and a non-stop thrill ride, while also having an appropriately uncompromising and far from rose tinted depiction of warfare. Those who say that it is the best battle sequence ever produced for television hit it on the head from personal opinion.'Game of Thrones' has always delivered in the acting. \"Blackwater\" is no exception and would go as far to say that it is one of the show's finest examples. Peter Dinklage is a fan favourite for very good reason and Tyrion continues to be one of the show's most consistently interesting characters. A big shout out also has to go to Lena Headey in her finest hour of the show up to this point, her final scene wrenches the gut.Visually, \"Blackwater\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Blackwater\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and wit. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Can't fault the direction either. Nor the writing or development of the characters, most shows could only wish to have characters with this amount of depth and complexity.To conclude, truly fantastic. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The Battle of Blackwater is well worth the wait, a textbook example of tension building and battle drama, full of the realistic bloodshed and gore you'd expect, like LORD OF THE RINGS for adults. The wildfire explosion still impresses after all these years, and the quieter dialogue scenes with Cersei, Sansa et al are just engrossing as the 'manly' action.",

There are close calls, changes of strategy, close quarter beheadings, point, counterpoint, pyrotechnics. It's sort of an invasion of Normandy kind of setting with the battlements, archers firing as the troops, most of them fodder for the attack, fall along the way. There are a series of unanswered questions and the fate of several people is at stake. Mostly, we want to know what is going on with Tyrion who has actually been betrayed though he fought valiantly and saved the king's backside. Who will now sit upon the throne or is it all's well that ends well? We shall see.",

Out of the blue, Tywin Lannister and the House Tyrell defeat Stannis and save King's Landing. \"Blackwater\" is the best episode of \"Games of Throne\" so far and the show of Tyrion. His strategy and bravery contrast with the cowardice and arrogance of the cruel and despicable Joffrey. How Tyrion will be rewarded for King's Landing we will see on the next episode. Sansa now has the chance to flee from the castle. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Blackwater\"",

                    "content": "Until now episodes of 'Game of Thrones' have followed multiple plot lines as we see what is happening with various characters in locations around Westeros and across the Narrow Sea; this time the entire episode is dedicated to showing us the Battle of Blackwater Bay. In the early parts of the episode we see the protagonists preparing themselves for the upcoming battle. Some spend the time with loved ones, others enjoy an evening of wine, women and song\u0085 most accept that that victory is far from assured; even while they are comforting those they care for. As the battle approaches the tension rises till the action suddenly starts as Tyrion sets fire to the bay and apparently gains the upper hand. The battle is far from won though and Stannis still has enough men to mount a formidable attack against the city. If the Lannisters are to survive Tyrion will have to rally is disheartened troops and lead the counterattack. While the battle rages Cersei and the women shelter in the Red Keep; here she tells Sansa what will happen if Stannis is victorious.This is possibly the best episode to date; it might not include any news of many major characters, including some person favourites, but in the excitement of what is happening it doesn't matter. The early part of the episode nicely raises the tension as we are led to believe that the city could fall\u0085 and after last season's killing of Ned Stark there was a feeling that another major character could just as easily be killed off. The battle starts in spectacular fashion as the wildfire tears through Stannis's fleet. This is only a starter though; the main course is the battle on the beach outside the city walls. In some of the series bloodiest scenes numerous soldiers are slain. These aren't clean kills; heads are crushed, several men are burnt alive and others are brutally hacked with swords and axes. The cast does a great job; Peter Dinklage is always great as Tyrion but this is his finest hour; his speech to the troops is genuinely stirring\u0085 one if fiction's great pre-battle speeches. Lena Headey and Sophie Turner do fine jobs as Cersei and Sansa; their scenes together as they prepare for what might happen are impressive. Overall a really thrilling episode with action so intense it wouldn't be out of place in a big budget Hollywood blockbuster and some fine character development.",

The feud between the arrogant/childish 17 year old Joffery and the rational/logical uncle Tyrion builds. The viewer is delight when Tyrion logically makes Joffery look childish. Tyrion builds a logical castle defence. What is Tyrion up to? The other story's hero Rob Stark decides to marry his true love over the arranged marriage. Rob is the true blue, non phony, kind hearted hero (that the audience loves) of the series. The other soap opera sub stories intertwine to create a bubbling stew for season two's finale.

Hands down the best episode of \"Game Of Thrones\" so far. On the whole, this episode really has no low points. Sophie Turner really shines in this episode, and she shares some good meaty scenes with Rory McCann (The Hound) Lena Headey (Cersi) and Sibel Kekilli (Shae) Jack Gleeson is fine as Joffrey who's too young and frightened to risk his own life while Stannis is perfectly willing to do so, leading the battle from the front. Stephen Dillane's Stannis comes off really well in this episode and Conleth Hill's Varys always shines, But this episode is all about one of my favourite characters and actors in the show Peter Dinklage's Tyrion Lannister. I have often praised his work on this show in my reviews. He won the Emmy for his work in the first season, and he should win another for his work in this episode alone. From the scene with Shae in bed where he talked about his nerves, to his rousing Speech to rally the troops after Joffery had fled to his work on the battlefield. He is simply superbIn the end, this is the show's finest hour in two seasons, and it's fitting it's the hour written by George R.R. Martin.",

Martin's sprawling, complicated saga is a joy to read, but often its page-to-screen adaptation jumps back and forth between story lines given little time to breath. The Blackwater battle provides a solid structure: for once we have a clear view of the chessboard and pieces, with their conflicts, goals and stakes.Also, Neil Marshall. The director of The Descent brings his visual flair to both battle scenes and quieter moments - his participation in the show a serendipitous incident (he was a last-minute replacement) fans can be thankful for.9/10",

Since The North Remembers I have desperately missed its cosmic editing. Contrary to the past episodes that only looked like a bunch of great scenes hastily joined together Blackwater was a full-blown television movie. Its story was unpredictable and featured many infernal moments. Of course the explosion sequence was jaw dropping, an hypnotic green fireworks, and definitely the one thing we will still remember in months but there were also plenty of other intense scenes. For instance when The Hound suddenly appeared beside Sansa in her bedroom I was convinced he was going to rape her. Instead their face off turned into a wicked homage to the Beauty and the Beast. Tyrion's speech to the soldiers made him grow on us even more and I really hope he'll survive his bloody wound because I'm not ready to let Peter Dinklage go. Game of Thrones needs him ! Losing Ned last season and Sean Bean in the process was painful enough. However I wouldn't blame George R. R. Martin if he had decided again to sacrifice again one of his mortal creatures.It leads us to Melisandre because I really expected her to show up and save the day when some of Stannis ships got annihilated. So I suppose we'll have to wait for the finale to witness what the old gods are capable of. Still I absolutely don't regret that magic wasn't part of the battle because it felt realistic, was served by a shockingly dark choreography and overall the production was just surreal ! In fact would it be wrong to compare it to what films like Braveheart and The Lord of the Rings : The Two Towers delivered ? I don't think so. They didn't fight in bright day light but the action couldn't have been gorier. The battle didn't feature elves, fantastic beasts nor mythological elements but it had a dwarf casting fireballs from his ass, a Joffrey who as expected acted like a pussy and brave men giving their life for what they thought was a noble cause ! My only major complain would be Cersei misplaced and way too numerous monologues. I really think they dramatically made the action less percussive when the battle shouldn't have been interrupted by anything. Otherwise it didn't ruin the experience, far from it, and I even suspect the women's side made things a little more vicious.Note : This review was first posted on Kritikenstein, my weblog.",

Politics, power, friendship, love and warfare intermingle in a delicious night to remember.",

                    "content": "Just finished watching the 9th episode of season 2, and it's a deja vu for me. Just like in the first season when Ned died, nothing else happened in the episode. Same here. Instead of living the drama of Stannis Baratheon trying to take the castle and how he reacted after losing so many ships, we are taken against our will by incompetent writers, to a world of wh*res to see their boring dialogues and monologues. The only good thing in this episode was Tyrion who has proved himself yet again to be better than all the other Lannisters.I don't understand why anyone finds this episode so perfect and magnificent, when it's only half warfare half boring women soap opera. At the start of the episode I was expecting so much given the rating, but came up empty handed and just as usually with a fantastic performance of Peter Dinklage who if it wasn't for him this show would have been a complete mess.So again what's with the rating? The episode before was way better in every aspect, drama, romance, character development(no one else other than Tyrion), intrigue and surprises, but here Stannis losing the battle surprise surprises no one.As for the end, time contradicting for writers. Tywin's army just arrived and started fighting Stannis's army and the queen tells stories to her son, and yet when the story is done(about five minutes), the war is over. Really? Does it takes that little time to end a war where you were still outnumbered like 3 to 1, or is it the writers want us to think that there were so few soldiers of Stannis who came to the gate after Tyrion's intervention? Looked to me like at least 1 or 2 thousands. They couldn't get killed that fast could they? But yeah again the writers cheat time because they had to close the episode somehow within an hour, after showing anything else but the war.In conclusion, I expected a rough fight and a tense drama about it like maybe in Rome season 2 The Battle Of Phillipi, but all I got was some women dialogues covering what was supposed to be a great battle.Overall good, but definitely not great, from me it's an 8, kindly an 8 at this point in the show.",

                    "content": "In \"Blackwater\", Game of Thrones' typical style is radically changed, which starts with the fact that the usual handful of locations are narrowed down to only one, King's Landing. This is, of course, serving the purpose of the huge battle at Blackwater bay, which gives the episode its title. The main cast contracts pertinently and only 11 of the usual 25 are left \u2013 something that on the other hand enhances the focus on those particular characters. Especially Tyrion, Cersei, and Sansa have more screen time than usual and guest writer George R. R. Martin, author of the show's source material, the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" series, includes a multitude of important character information into the cleverly written and grandly acted dialogs. However, it's unlikely the awkward conversations between Queen Regent Cersei and Queen to-be Sansa about the possibility of the latter getting raped by Stannis' troops, nor the entertaining \"F\u2014k everything\" attitude of our canine friend in the King's Guard, Sandor Clegane, that audiences will remember about this episode. What happens in the last five scene of \"Blackwater\", with an absolutely stunning twist that will leave your mouth wide open during the whole ending credits, makes it a fan- favorite. But first things first: it actually takes the episode quite some time to gain momentum and not one scene in the first quarter of an hour was really something special. The looming fleets of Stannis Baratheon excited me and looked really good, yet I knew that this wasn't nearly the full potential of the show. Slowly but surely, one-time Game of Thrones director Neil Marshall manages to get the right mood on the screen and once Tyrion's sellsword Bronn lets loose of his fiery arrow in the direction of Stannis, the episode's mood varies dramatically. The following wildfire explosion is unbelievable, but the battle isn't over, it has just begun. Before we get to massive bloodshed in front of the Mud Gate, however, there's a cut to Cersei and Sansa, fifty-fifty voluntarily getting drunk in Maegor's Holdfast, where they are separated from the martial outside world. And then, in the second half of \"Blackwater\", an unforgettable battle commences, that is understandably small scale in comparison to cinema blockbusters, but includes umpteen awesome close-combat killings, fantastically realized by director Marshall. Much of the gore scenes, that made the show quite notorious for TV circumstances, are there as well and they are so artistically done that it's impossible to not have fun with it. But it wouldn't be Game of Thrones if the final scene weren't a jaw-dropping surprise. Lena Headey as Cersei is amazing in an extremely emotional finale that alternately shows her and her son Tommen in the Throne Room and Tyrion and Stannis on the battle field. All of this is almost too enthralling to watch and culminates in the arrival of Loras Tyrell. Remember, the audience doesn't know on which side he and his family are on at this point and that makes the scene with him entering the Red Keep one of the best moments in the whole show.\"Blackwater\" is undeniably one of the most rememberable Game of Thrones episodes, even though I personally found the first third to be too slow and also found several inaccuracies and logical flaws (How does Stannis now that Tyrion is responsible for the Wildfire? How can Stannis climb up the latter to King's Landing first of all without anyone of the Lannister's attacking him?). I do think that the hype about this episode is a bit disproportionate, but \"Blackwater\" is nevertheless one of the show's highlights.",

I can't wait to see the battle of castle black on season 4, it'll top blackwater I heard, and it'll be drawn out, bloody, gory, intense, brutal, exciting, and adrenaline rushing just like blackwater was :-). season 4 will be insane, it'll have more action, more blood, and more gore than ever before, the fans are in for a real treat since a storm of swords is balls out insane",

You actually feel bad for her while before this you wanted her dead probably.Tyrion is the star of this episode thou and the whole season. With his biggest moments of triumph and defeat. I wont spoil it but with everything that happens and the conflicts of who you want to survive or win. It's just perfect and is the writing is even better than the spectacle which is saying alot.",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 2's last episode \"Valar Morghulis\", meaning \"all men must die\" as explained in Season 3's \"Walk of Punishment\", is a grand finale for a very strong season. It is not quite as spectacular as \"Blackwater\", for me the \"Baelor\" of Season 2, but everything that is so good about 'Game of Thrones' is in full throe and to exceptional quality.'Game of Thrones' has always delivered in the acting. \"Valar Morghulis\" is no exception. Peter Dinklage is a fan favourite for very good reason and Tyrion continues to be one of the show's most consistently interesting characters. Alfie Allen is also splendid, Theon very nearly rivalling Joffrey in the nasty piece of work department, not quite though, Joffrey is as reprehensible a character as one can get.Visually, \"Valar Morghulis\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Valar Morghulis\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and wit. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.There are quite a number of surprises and one cannot imagine a more ominous final scene than the one here.Can't fault the direction either. Nor the writing or development of the characters, most shows could only wish to have characters with this amount of depth and complexity.Summing up, truly grand. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

There's bonding for Jaime and Brienne, Arya going into a new direction and saying goodbye to a new friend, sea change within King's Landing, and more than a little romance in Robb's camp. The highlights are inevitably the showdown between Daenerys and her oppressors in Qarth and the torrid and shocking events at Winterfell, the latter a particular stand-out here. Plus there's that exceptional ending, which makes you wish that they'd had the budget to do the big night's watch vs. white walker battle at this stage of the show.",

Thirdly, the dialogue is excellently crafted, with wit on the one hand and mayhem on the other. We have the beauty of a series where the bad guys often get away with things, where retribution doesn't always work. Where people die, even though they seem to be principles in the show. I cannot wait to see how things play out in Season 3.",

                    "content": "As I have said before, I am not a particular fan of swords and sorcery style stories, full of long names and even longer genealogy charts to help you keep track of who is who; it isn't a genre that ever has me searching for more even if I have enjoyed it in some instances. That said, I am a fan of well told stories that engage me and surprise me in equal measure, and it is for this reason that I came to the second season of Game of Thrones and is also the reason why I will feel every month until I get to watch the third season and continue all these stories.With the first season I felt it took me a minute or two to get into the tone of the show and also understand the basic characters enough to be able to get caught up in what was happening; with the second I had no such time and I was keen to get back into the battle as various armies marched across the land while small threats build overseas and political betrayal is embedded in every conversation of those seeking power for themselves. The war means that the second season has a much larger and perhaps simpler agenda but at the same time there are plenty of smaller moments and manoeuvring of characters that I continued to find as enjoyable as I did unpredictable. Not having read the book and being keen to avoid spoilers, all the various twists and turns of the plot was news to me, whether it be the turn of the war or the specifics of an individual character, and each story arch held me easily with no one thread being of more interest than another. The only obvious downside of having so much to squeeze in is that occasionally there are gaps in threads that are just left to save time \u2013 this is best seen in the final episode where several characters go from one situation to a different location without it really being clear how they did this. I imagine this \"squeeze\" effect is much harder for those coming from the books to the show.That said, the season is impressive in how well it does this with relatively little time on each thread. Every second and every line of dialogue is important and are therefore mostly used very well to deliver character, motivation and also plot. The cast respond to this well and even the smaller characters are played in such a way that you are interested in them, which helps the nature of the telling where one cannot be sure who will live and who will die considering that characters who appear to be \"main\" can quickly be dispatched and forgotten within a few episodes if the plot turns in that direction. Generally I was impressed a lot more this season as characters grew and developed. Dinklage continues to give a great performance and is my favourite in terms of colour, although only marginally more than Gleeson, who delivers a monstrous c*** who is as arrogant as he is ill-suited for this role as King. Headey has grown on me more this season, as has Coleraine-girl Fairley. Likewise Allen, Harington, Gillen, Madden, Glen, Clarke and others all do strong work across their characters \u2013 too many to mention in fact, it is a real boon of the show that there are so many characters and yet I am interested in all of them and all of their threads.The production looks great as well. I'm sure those who know the books inside out will complain about the presentation of some of the larger battles but for me nothing here felt limited by budget \u2013 it all felt like they did it that way because this was the way that worked best. Costumes, sets and locations all continue to be great and I got a nice kick out of this season being the first time I recognised somewhere they had used (Pyke being the nearby Ballintoy harbour in Northern Ireland). The gore and the nudity are excessive but they work because they fit with the excessive and colourful nature of the telling and the grand, gaudy sweep of the bloody tales.Season 2 of this show doesn't disappoint. It delivers an engaging overall story with loads of threads and seeds for future threads and does it in a way that makes it all look easy. So much going on could easily have seen the show have weaker threads that annoy for taking up time but this doesn't happen and even though some characters and threads have lesser time, I was interested in all of them and in their threads. Not knowing the books really helps as well since no character are pushed to the fore or seem immune to the bloody and cruel twists of fate that are common here. Great show \u2013 a year will be a very long wait for the third season.",

When Tyrion wakes he discovers that he is also no longer the Hand of the King. As battle honours are handed out Lord Baelish is rewarded for his loyalty and Joffrey sets aside his promise to wed Sansa Stark to become engaged to Lady Margaery Tyrell. Meanwhile in Winterfell Theon and his small force of Iron Islanders are besieged by a superior force; Theon gives a rousing speech but his men have had enough of him and have no intention of dying from him far from the sea. Across the Narrow Sea in Qarth Daenerys enters the House of the Dead to retrieve her dragons; here she will endure a series of visions before being reunited with her young dragons and facing her captors. north of the wall it looks as if Jon Snow has betrayed the Night's Watch and the White Walkers are on the move; heading towards the wall! Elsewhere Arya says good bye to Jaqen H'ghar, Robb marries Talisa, despite his mother's warnings that it will have consequences and Brienne of Tarth must fight a trio of Stark soldiers to defend her prisoner.After the amazing battle scenes in the previous episode one might expect things to be less dramatic\u0085 while there is less action there is still some and more is promised. The best of the action was Brienne's fight; Gwendoline Christie makes us believe that her character would have little difficulty dispatching three soldiers. Peter Dinklage continues to impress as we see Tyrion coming to terms with the fact that his part in the victory will be totally ignored and far from being rewarded his status is considerably lower than before. The scenes north of the wall nicely lead us to question Jon's allegiance and the final scenes remind us that Winter is Coming and along with it the White Walkers. Equally the scenes in Qarth are enjoyable as Daenerys enters the mysterious House of the Dead and later we learn just what Xaro Xhoan Daxos has in his impregnable vault. There are plenty of other interesting scenes each hinting of things to come.This episode brings season two to an impressive end; wrapping up some plot lines and beginning some new ones that will undoubtedly be important in the future episodes. I'm sure viewers will be keen to see what season three brings.",

It is not the worst episode the show has ever made, but it's a long way from being the best. Overall it's been a good second season, my favourite storyline was probably Arya's and my favourite scenes were the ones that featured Arya and Tywin Lannister, or Arya and Jaquen H'gar. (I hope that's not the last we see of him) Another obvious one is Tyrion's storyline. I have been very vocal about my love for Dinklage, his scenes with Varys and Bronn were a joy.

                    "content": "In season two's last episode, King's Landing gets a thorough update that includes a new Hand of the King, a new Queen for Joffrey, and a new alliance for Sansa. On much bigger scale, however, are Daenerys' dragons making for fiery tumult in the city of Qarth, Samwell Tarly encountering well-disposed white walkers on his little nature hike, and just by the way, Winterfell burning down. Now that explains the additional ten minutes for \"Valar Morghulis\".Things are quickly back to normal for most of King's Landing's residents and Joffrey is all love, peace and harmony when naming his gramps Tywin the new Hand of the King \u2013 who is as cool about that as his horse is about defecating right in the Red Keep. Right afterwards, Ser Loras Tyrell had the impudence to propose his ambitious sister Margaery to the King and that unpredictable tike just dropped Sansa and decided to wed Renly's widow. You know, that reckless \"whatever\" attitude young people have nowadays. Sansa, apparently not that overwhelmed by The Hound's offer to take her back to Winterfell in \"Blackwater\", now has the next guy volunteering for a ride to her home \u2013 Petyr Baelish, new Lord of Harrenhal (oh right, Joffrey disposed that as well). I'm not entirely sure how the girl is going to decide since Littlefinger does seem a bit creepy when he's subliminally incorporating his lusting for her mother every time he talks to Sansa. In less splendid chambers, Tyrion wakes up with \u2013 nah, you didn't expect that \u2013 Grand Maester Pycelle standing in front of his bed. That mendacious old fellow whose talking pace is about one word every five seconds is feeling really great when fooling Tyrion in the same way Tyrion fooled him earlier this season. Varys and Shae too get to spend time with the scarred imp, who is understandably not too happy about his current situation. I'm still not sure if I should buy the emotions between Peter Dinklage and Sibel Kekilli though, that just doesn't really seem genuine to me.In entirely unrelated business, the episode's gibberish title is thankfully defined \u2013 it's a phrase that the faceless joker Jaqen H'ghar made up just for kicks so Arya could find him. I've loved every single interaction between Maisie Williams and Tom Wlaschiha and their farewell in this episode (or is it?) is outstanding. That's not applicable for Jaqen's new face, however. Couldn't that guy find anything more attractive in Harrenhal's second-face-shop? It was definitely a great effect, though.Now to the absolutely stunning stuff \"Valar Morghulis\" had in store: at first there's little Theon getting angry about his unwinnable position, but then he regains his self-confidence in a war speech that I actually found not bad, only to be betrayed by his own men. Well, that really wasn't the best season for Theon. Same goes for Bran and Rickon who relinquish their hideout, only to discover that their actual home is not really there anymore. So are the Greyjoy troops, miraculously gone with the wind, and Maester Luwin, suffering from a fatal wound in the Godswood. And even though he was never a very big character, Luwin's passing is extraordinarily touching and I feel that I'll miss his wise monologues in future seasons.The best parts are saved up for the final quarter of an hour, namely the Daenerys and Jon Snow story lines. Say what you will about their scenes in season two so far (I personally reckon them to be outstanding), but how everything turns out for them in this episode is undeniably perfect. Daenerys gets more screen time than ever as she is put into a dream-like state in Pyat Pree's House of the Undying and enters three jaw-dropping venues. As Jason Momoa returns with their son, a new apex is reached in terms of how awesome a scene can be while still having subtitles, and her reconnoitering a snowy version of the Throne Room had visuals too amazing to describe in words. But no, best part of the episode is still not reached and the Khaleesi is back to the real world and meets the aforementioned scary warlock who is, to his detriment, unaware of the fact that dragons can spit fire and dies one off the greatest deaths in the series. You go, Daenerys' dragons! Not enough of them still, and after the bogus King of Qarth whose name is clearly too long to write out gets locked up for death in his own, sadly empty, treasury together with Doreah (her dishonesty is only a surprise if you haven't watched the Blu-Ray Easter Eggs), the Mother of Dragons walks off with her three children (her words, not mine) on her shoulders, which is almost too cool to watch, seriously.But no, the episode's apex is still not reached and it also isn't Jon Snow killing Qhorin Halfhand (say wat) in the show's most touching, yet also most flawless swordfight. The first view of Mance Rayder's abode comes quite close to the top on my \"The 50 best things in Valar Morghulis\" list, but it really is the final shot that makes \"Valar Morghulis\" the second best Game of Thrones episode until that point (I ultimately prefer \"Winter Is Coming\" even though not a single person on Earth agrees with me). The White Walkers approaching the Fist of the First Men is mind-blowingly good and one of the best zombie scenes in TV and also movie history. Left-alone Sam (he is quite a klutz, admittedly) seeing all of this in indescribable awe enhances the intensity additionally and then he sees him: the White Walker on a dead horse (a White Warmblood, right?), which is the shot that spread all over the internet. Understandably, considering it's just freaking awesome. So is most of the rest of this episode. It's not perfect, but it's damn close to it and it deserves a 10 since you'll never forget it.",

                    "content": "I couldn't see anyway that Season 2 was going to live up to the 1st Season, for me, Season 1 was faultless. Game Of Thrones: Season 2 did a solid job in continuing the fantasy epic, it built on the characters very well, moved along at a pleasant pace and stayed true to its roots with its impeccable dialogue and story-telling.As a whole, the season is quite slowly paced, dedicating much more time to character building. The introduction of new characters is always a tricky task, especially introducing several in a short space of time. Within the first 3 episodes we are shown 6 or 7 new characters, many of which go on to have very important roles in the up and coming seasons. Existing characters which got little screen time in season 1 are also given larger roles whilst also focusing heavily on the already established characters from the previous series. Tyrion is featured heavily in this season building on his likable reputation even more while other characters are given more screen time and you really start to despise them. John Snow, Arya, Theon and Joffrey all especially stand out for me with solid performances and important story lines. A TV show has never had the ability to make me dislike certain people as much as Game of Thrones and Season 2 goes a long way to making this happen. Even the small-time characters which have little screen time have a remarkable knack of being interesting and intriguing \u2013 nobody feels out of place or unnecessary.The production from start to finish looks great, the sets, CGI, costumes and locations are all perfect again. Watching this show in HD with a decent surround sound system is quite the experience! Season 2 is gruesome and explicitly violent, contains strong nudity, strong language and delves deeper into the fantasy realms than its previous series. It isn't as strong as season 1 but it is a strong second season, offering everything that you would want. The story is told perfectly and the introduction of many more characters is implemented faultlessly.The pacing is spot on and scenarios start to unravel very nicely, tension is built and many questions are left unanswered \u2013 making you want to keep on watching! Daenerys scenes can get a little tiring and repetitive but this part of the show is very important for future episodes and when looking back, the character development you see of her is very significant.Season 2 ends on a strong note, exploding in episode 9. Previous episodes build up to this perfectly and the climax doesn't disappoint. With an estimated budget of $8,000,000 for episode 9, it shows off its power with an incredible battle scene, you forget that you are watching a TV drama, with a budget like that, it's an easy mistake. Episode 10, gets back to normal and ends the season on a strong note, a real cliff-hanger, giving you a small taste of what is to come!My only real negative from the whole season was the Daenerys storyline, I felt that it started to drag a little towards the end and the climax felt a little flat. However as I said before, looking back on this storyline, you really get to see significant progression in her character which is very important for future seasons.Overall, Season 2 is weaker than Season 1 but that was hardly a surprise for me as the first Season is one of the strongest I have ever seen out of any TV show. Season 2 does however build characters very strongly with many characters stepping up with much more screen time and fascinating stories. It includes various, very strong plots and answers questions from the previous season, contains some very solid stories and leaves key questions unanswered for future episodes. Season ratings so far: Season 1 \u2013 10/10. Season 2 \u2013 9/10.",

Since these episodes are being adapted from Novels of the same name, we really can't fault the Script Writers too much for this mess; however, the Directing has not done anything to improve the story that seems to have been stretched out way past it's Due Date. The magic elements in the first season were tastefully and carefully placed in the story when and where they were an asset. Now this TV Franchise has turned into a bad Halloween Movie.

A lot of waffle, a bit of nudity to break the boredom, the odd battle, irritating squabbles, a fair bit of wooden acting... Only part I really found impressive was the battle in episode 9.I don't think I'll bother to spend 10 hours of my life watching season 3 next year.Very, very disappointed.",

Now the wildlings understand his level of awesome and it seems him taking over their massive army is inevitable. Speaking of massive army, the winter people have also make their appearance and could seriously hurt Jon Snow's chances. It's too bad it looks like they're about to fight each other instead of bonding together against the inbred rat, like they should. Hopefully Daenyrus falls in love with Jon Snow and then he can have the dragons behind him (which would come in handy for people who only die with fire...).",

Once that happens, depending both on the writing talent, and the quality of the original work, the adaptation could go in several directions.It seems that this season has gone the way of almost total inconsistency. By that I'll use an example from this season. WHAT IS DEAD MAY NEVER DIE (03) was a terrific episode, perhaps one of the best in the series, and it was followed by GARDEN OF BONES (04) which is pretty mediocre.It's clear, then, that as the writers stray from the source material (and they do, rather substantially, in the second half of the season) their mediocre talents stand out among the source material's already high quality.The season started off quite well, however, with the first three episodes being quite strong, but then some perplexing adaptation choices and poor writing made the middle of the season quite mediocre. It did pick up again, but then the finale was an hour of anti-climaxes and half-climaxes, failing to do what the season one finale succeeded in: tying up loose ends with emotional momentum, rounding off character arcs, and setting up for the next season.Best Episode: What Is Dead May Never Die (03) Best Actor: Alfie Allen",

Zombies are not even in the realm of fantasy unless you are in a Michael Jackson \"Thriller\" video. The other reason is minimal but, when burning of a body on top of a northern mountain, you'd have to have some sort of fuel. There is nothing there but snow and rocks. They seem to have come up with the ability of start a blazing fire at a moments notice. This was too much for me and took me out of the moment.",

                    "content": "This is a review for both the season and finale.First, the latter. This episode, was spectacular. Dropping the single event style of last weeks - battle of blackwater, the show returns to its many storyline style. Season 2 story arks such as Jon's, theon's, Dany's, Tyrion's and Arya's are completed and the stage is set for story's such as Sansa's, Jaime's, Robb's and Bran's to become more interesting in season 3. Individual scenes; well of course the final cliffhanger (zombie apocalypse scene) was amazing, I loved the scene between littlefinger and Sansa in the throne room (both Aidan and Sophie are incredible at acting), Alfie Allen's scenes were as always fantastic and also the scene between Tyrion and Shae, which almost made me cry. Scenes that they could have done better were the surrounding and burning of Winterfell; which they didn't explain well at all. That it was actually Ramsay Bolton who burned in and not the Greyjoys. The house of the undying, could have been better though it was better than i thought. Should have had more foreshadowing - as it did in the book.Stand out performances include, Alfie Allen and his amazing speech, John Bradley's fear in the white walker scene and Emilia Clarke for finally showing her true awesomeness that we haven't seen such the season 1 finale - when she locked her traitor handmaid in that room, I got chills.Rightio! Season 2 has been all in all, a slightly weaker season than the first, though this probably should have been predicted as its based upon Clash of Kings which is basically the build up to book 3, book, and is widely considered to be the second weakest after Feast. That said, it was still awesome. Tyrion's kings landing scenes were brilliant, As well as Theon's greyjoy scenes and finally Arya and jaqen, Arya and Tywin...well Arya and everyone. :P Stand out scenes, include that awesome scene at the end of Blackwater - flashing between Cersei telling Tommen the story and Tyrion blacking out as his father rides in...actually scrap that, the whole of Blackwater! Also Theon being rejected by his father, burning the letter and then getting baptised and Jaime's amazing Honour and vows conversation with Catelyn. Stand out acting this season from Alfie Allen as Theon, Sophie turner as Sansa, Peter Dinklage as Tyrion, Jack Gleeson as Joffrey and Maisey Williams as Arya. The only reasons this season fell down compared to the last is occasions of not giving all the info in the writing which confused the new viewers, less action, minus Blackwater of course and occasions where Dan and Dave deviated from the source material and it didn't pay off. The prime example of this is Jon Snow's story which I think is stronger in the books.In conclusion though, these are only little niggles, this season is fantastic. Fantastic writing, storytelling, acting, scenery, cgi, battles and character development. A must watch for those who haven't. Season 1 - 10/10 season 2 - 9/10 season 3 - will undoubtedly rise back to 10 as it is based upon the strongest book in the series - storm of swords. Thanks for reading, hope this is useful. x",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Valar Dohaeris\", with my review summary referring to its English meaning, is a great Season 3 opener. Even if there were episodes from the previous two seasons that were bigger and bolder and understandably new ideas and characters gave the impression of still settling. They for my liking weren't quite used enough, with the episode deftly reminding us briefly but deftly of events from Season 2 and expanding them. Just my personal opinion. It may sound like \"Valar Dohaeris\" is not a good episode, actually as said already it's a great one with so much done brilliantly.The characterisation of the older and popular characters continues to excel with some memorable scenes and subplots that weren't as interesting or developed in Season 2 expanded. Appreciated highly the advancing of Daenerys'. In terms of memorable scenes, the exchange between Tywin and Tyrion packs a big emotional punch and is one of Season 3's strongest moments dramatically.Peter Dinklage, Charles Dance, Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke are particularly wonderful here and Ciaran Hinds in his introductory appearance is a welcome addition.Visually, \"Valar Dohaeris\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Valar Dohaeris\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Direction is superb as is, even more so, the acting with not a single weak link.In conclusion, great and a great sign of what was to follow. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

I particularly liked the eastern material with Daenerys et al, which promises to broaden and change things considerably from the smaller scale of the previous season. The King's Landing intrigue is as thick as ever and there's even a chance to see Joffrey displaying a more human side, something I never thought I'd see.",

Joffrey is certainly feeling his oats but may begin to wonder at the price he may pay for his coming marriage. Margery has the should of the people and stops in a dangerous place to talk to some orphans about the courage of their fathers. She promises that the king will look after them. The queen is obviously disturbed because her Freudian connection may be severed (she has so many edges). Tyrion gets to talk with his father. He finds he has been used again. The family, it would seem, is the center of things, yet Tyrion must always prove himself. The fact that his mother died giving birth to him trumps everything and his accomplishments are constantly diminished. It would appear that the dwarf brother is starting to realize that he has no friends at all. As a matter of fact, it is clear that should he consider carrying on his relationship with the woman he loves, she will be killed summarily. The balancing of all factors going forth in the war is the strength of this episode. We also have Dani trying to raise an army and coming on a pack of 8,000 mercenaries who have killed babies to get where they are. Her dragons are not mature, but she needs troops now and it will be interesting if she will go along with the wishes of the evil.",

Tyrion has a meeting with his father that does not believe that he saved King's Landing from Stannis. Littlefinger offers to help Sansa to Leave King's Landing with him while Ros advises Shae to take care of Sansa and to not trust in Littlefinger. Davos is rescued from an island by Salladhor and he asks to be bought to Dragonstone with the intention of killing Melisandre. Robb and his army arrive at Harrenhal and find all prisoners murdered and only one survivor. Daenerys arrives at Astapor and she negotiates slave-soldiers known as Unsullied with the trader Kraznys mo Nakloz. She is also saved from an attempt of murder from a magician by Barristan Salmy.\"Valar Dohaeris\" shows a good beginning of the Third Season of \"Game of Thrones\". How will be the life of Jon Snow living with his enemies is an intriguing point. Will he change his viewpoint regarding the Wildings? The treatment of Tywin despising his son Tyrion explains part of the behavior of the imp. Sansa does not know that Littlefinger betrayed he father and Ros's pertinent advice to Shae is relevant. But the most promising part of this season seems to be Daenerys and her dragons. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Valar Dohaeris\"",

                    "content": "This episode follows on immediately after the events of season two. After the talk of Mance Rayder, the King beyond the Wall, John Snow finally meets the man and is asked why he wants to abandon the Night's Watch and join his Wildling forces. Meanwhile the rest of the Night's Watch decide that they must return south to the wall to warn of the threat from the White Walkers. Back in King's Landing Tyrion is disappointed when his father refuses to give him what he had expected for leading the operation that had saved the city; Margaery Tyrell shows that she has an understanding of the common people that others around the king can't rival and Lord Baelish offers to help Sansa leave the city. We also learn that Davos Seaworth survived the Battle of Blackwater Bay; upon being found he returns to Stannis and discovers that things aren't going well as Melisandre continues to influence him. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys heads to the city of Astapor to by an army of Unsullied; slave warriors who will follow any order without question; she clearly doesn't approve of slavery but if she is to take the Iron Throne she will need an army and they are the best.While there isn't a huge amount of action this is a good start to the third season; it nicely reminds us what is happening with most, but not all, of the major characters. The most interesting events are those that take place away from the Seven Kingdoms; Jon Snow's meeting with Mance Rayder was handled in an interesting way and even managed to produce a laugh when Jon identifies the wrong person as Mance, the giant at the Wildlings camp was also pretty cool. The scenes with Daenerys in Astapor were also interesting as they introduce the Unsullied and the scene where their owner insults Daenerys while translator, Missandei, gives a more polite version was nicely amusing. The other scenes were good too; with a nice mix of plot progression, reminding us what has happened and some mild humour. As expected the acting is impressive throughout; making us believe in the characters even in the more fantastical scenes. The effects for these fantastical scenes are really good; making the unreal seem real. Overall a fine episode that set things up for the upcoming season in an impressive way.",

Missandei translating the insulting remarks humourous, while now knowing Daenerys can hear it all.Game of Thrones is a great show, but there are so many characters and different plots, that there are quite a few I just don't care about.Tyrion, Jon, Tywin and Daenerys the standouts.",

There's not a great deal to say about it, when it deliberately avoids trying to sustain the momentum of last season's finale.It is a slow moving episode, I suspect the feeling of slowness has to do with the fact that there are no big surprises. Given the slower pace, what this episode is really about is the characters and re-establishing them and their relationships, both old and new. We have Tyrion and Tywin meeting once again. This scene is the highlight of the episode, as Dance and Dinklage get across the bitter reality of their family life. The scene with Cersei before it continues the trend of examining the family dynamic, and the actors do a fair job getting it across. Tyrion's wariness around his sister is well-deserved, especially when we consider the fact that on the show it's been suggested to Tyrion that Cersei herself was behind the attempt on his life.We do get our first look at Mance Rader, Tortmund, The Unsullied and Quyburn, a character who will go on to be very important.All in all, despite the quibbles, despite the disappointment in the introductions of the new characters whom book readers had anticipated so much, this was a solid start. Individually, most of the scenes hang well together, with the actors all in top form, and there's a good level of coherence. They avoided the pitfall of last year's opener, which was trying to catch up with every single character (plus giving significant time to a brand new region and characters in it), and so were able to give the scenes they did have just a bit more room to breath. It's only a shame that they loaded so much of last season's finale with the surprises and twists that could have opened this show, and given these scenes a sense of borrowed urgency simply by their juxtaposition wih the surprises that they could have had.",

It was a good return to see some of the main characters. Tyrion is quite low in life now that his father looks down on him. Lady Margarey the new queen is such the polar opposite of King Joffrey making him look even more cruel. Beyond the wall John has finally found the right people to join which includes Ciarian Hinds as the leader of the Wildlings. Daenerys was underused last season and already she is being used much better with her strong disposition which include the dragons which are such great visual effects as they look very real when beside humans. Stannis is still a character more talked about that I do not care for yet so I will see what happens with him when more battles occur. Rob is OK in his ways as he also prepares for the throne like everyone on the show does. A great return and now I seem to respect the universe more which is why I'm happier episodes will be longer hopefully giving more characters screen time to lengthen their stories.EPISODE GRADE: B+ (MVP: Emilia Clarke)",

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's move on.Before I begin, for full disclosure, I am an avid fan of the book series, so my views and opinions on the show are somewhat biased. As such, it's impossible not to notice when major events happen differently from the books I am a junkie for, but it's part of the reason an adaptation like this is interesting to watch.The difficulty of adapting these novels into one-hour television entr\u00e9es is readily apparent. The lack of any sort of episodic nature, central plot, or main protagonist, as well as a list of characters and locales a mile long makes even recapping the events of the episode an endeavor. But as the show enters the third season, it is apparent that the producers have more than hit their stride, having a clear understanding of when to hold back, and how to focus an episode not around every character, but themes and ideas. With the failure of Stannis' major assault of King's Landing in the explosive Battle of Blackwater Bay, the players have mostly been scattered, routed, or are taking breathers after a close shave. And it's this lull in the action that gives the producers perfect opportunity to hint at the season's narrative arcs, and by all indications it's going to be leagues beyond the thoroughly enjoyable yet oftentimes unmemorable season two.The premiere, wonderfully titled \"Valar Dohaeris\" as a response to the season two finale, \"Valar Morghulis\" (readers will know what this means), begins with an atypical cold open (get it?) several hours from where we were left with the previous finale, in which the initial appearance of the shambling white walker army petrifies the admitted cowardly Samwell Tarly. Luckily, with the start of the premiere, he has found his feet and somehow escaped from the horrors surrounding him. Before he can catch his breath however, he's set upon by one of the frosty corpses brandishing an axe, only to be saved moments before his would-be beheading by an impeccably timed dire wolf lunge, and a torch from the small group of Night's Watch survivors. Although a glimpse of the battle at the Fist of the First Men (the mountaintop where the rangers made camp) would have been greatly preferable, the scene is tense, and provides just enough action to get the blood pumping before the ever-changing opening credits.Meanwhile still north of the wall, Jon Snow finally reaches the massive wildling camp, under watch of the way too clean and pretty looking Ygrite (seriously, where's the dirt? You live in a hut), home of the mythical giants and equally mythical Mance Rayder, \"the King Beyond the Wall.\" In meeting Mance, Jon is treated to another look into a world of alien freedom where, although given respect, no man is beholden to a lord.To read the rest of the recap/review (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/game-of-thrones-3-1-valar-dohaeris/",

It nicely sets the stage for the new seasons with new subplots and interesting scenes.",

                    "content": "I believe it is not too bold a statement to say that Game of Thrones is one of the best programmes to have graced our television screens. Power, greed, violence, sex, incest, fantasy \u2013 you name it, the show has it and so wonderfully put together thanks to the masterful craftwork of David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. For the past two series watching each episode was a weekly event, an hour of pure captivation down to the shows sheer epic-ness. Tonight was no exception, as the premiere episode of Season 3 reminded us of just how brilliant it is and how much we have actually missed it. If, like me, you haven't had time to re-watch Seasons 1 and 2, it may take a while for past events to come together. Thankfully, however, we join the first episode where Season 2 ended, the aftermath of the Battle of Blackwater, Jon Snow's integration into the Wildlings and as Tywin Lannister so helpfully summarises, there are \"seven kingdoms to look after, three of which are in rebellion\".In a pre-credit sequence we join the surviving Nights Watch men after an attack from the White Walkers. They declare their loyalty to protecting the seven kingdoms and vow to return to the wall, to warn of the dangers approaching with winter's arrival. After being captured by the Wildlings, Jon Snow is taken to their community (giants and all) and speaks to Mance Rayder, their king. After a startling discovery at the wall in which Craster fed a baby to a White Walker, Jon pledges his loyalty to the Wildlings, wishing to \"fight for the right side\". Queue title sequence and Ramin Djawadi's instantly recognisable score. We're back.King's Landing is severely affected after the war. First on a literal level, as surrounding scenery is masked with development and construction, whilst bodies (victim of wildfire) wash up on shore. Second on an emotional and personal level. Joffrey Baratheon is hated more than ever (although perhaps soon to be salvaged thanks to Margaery Tyrell's charitable work) and Tyrion, despite his grand efforts in the war, remains no good to bear the Lannister name. In a wonderfully written and heartbreaking exchange, Tywin Lannister makes this known via discourse of hatred, embarrassment and ridicule. He effectively declares Tyrion to be the bottom rung of the Lannister family and expresses un- paternal wishes. It's to Charles Dance and Peter Dinklage's credit that this scene is so effective. Dance's slurry of venom mixed with Dinklage's pained expressions is a truly captivating moment. Boy how I have missed their presenceMeanwhile, we join Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons at sea, on her mission to build an army. She travels to the city of Astapor to buy an army of trained slave soldiers, known as the 'Unsullied'. So brutal are they, they've killed babies and show no grimace at getting their nipples chopped off. Their stone stature was not as impressive however, as the subtle comedic translated exchange between Daenerys and the army's trainer. Both characters jibe at one another regarding their morals, or lack there of, referring to a recurring theme in Game of Thrones \u2013 how low will people stoop resultant from their lust for power? Whilst in Astapor, an attempted assassination of Daenerys by the warlocks of Qarth fails, and she is saved by Barristan Selmy, the former commander to her father, who pledges his loyalty.Elsewhere in the episode, we return to Davos, reeling with injuries from the wildfire explosion and mourning the death of his son. He returns to Dragonstone to speak to Stannis Baratheon, only to be locked up after his attack on Melisandre, who appears to have a dark hold over Stannis. Robb Stark continues to travel with his army, wishing to fight the Lannisters. Still angry at his mother for releasing Jamie Lannister (for the safety of Arya and Sana), he expresses his wishes for her to remain locked up. Each of these character tropes remain out of the spotlight this episode, however, leaving depth and focus toward the aforementioned developments of Daenerys and the Lannisters. It is a wise move for this season's opening, as we're taken to the heart of the action and emotion for the time being. As always with Game of Thrones, some story arcs take a while to get going but I have no doubt that it will all be developed brilliantly in due time.It is worth mentioning the noticeable improvement to the look of the show. To me it felt more vivid, brighter and beautiful. Whilst the majority of additions were CGI, long shots from different locations nevertheless showcased the developments of scenery on a grander scale than seen previously. Game of Thrones is definitely upping its, er... game. A most impressive return - welcome back Game of Thrones. I've never been so excited for winter.",

I loved this first episode, mostly because it reminders me of what made first season so damn good! The usual stuff as the acting and production size (costumes, settings, etc) are as good and rich as always. However, the best thing in this episode is the writing, mostly because, once again, it stays true to the books. Of course there are some minor changes, but like in the first season, you even enjoy said changes (unlike last season's incomprehensible changes) and some of the best lines are taken directly from the books, making this episode better still. I hope both D.B. and Benioff continue this way, for this is the formula that makes this TV series so intensely good! My ten-out-of-ten rating goes particularly to the scene between Tyrion and Tywin, and of course, the ending of the episode.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Valar Dohaeris\" was a great Season 3 opener. The season's second episode \"Dark Wings, Dark Words\" is even better. Things feel more settled, more is done with the new characters and their story lines while deftly reiterating those of the older characters and advancing those. It's not the biggest, most epic or boldest of 'Game of Thrones' episodes, and more intimate and character heavy, but all the better for it due to how many characters it introduces. The start of the episode is a bit slow, but overall there is a lot going on and a lot of characters but this is not a case of being over-stuffed or over-crowded.All the acting is fine across the board, Peter Dinklage is particularly brilliant of the non-new characters, not a surprise as he is always a high point of the show. Diana Rigg is the standout of the new additions.Visually, \"Dark Wings, Dark Words\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Dark Wings, Dark Words\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Direction is superb as is, even more so, the acting with not a single weak link.Overall, great stuff. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The three kids are grabbed up by a group of renegades and kept with them. Arya challenges on to a fight and he soon disarms her. Unfortunately, as they are about to take off, a discovery is made, and not for the good. Theon is tortured. I can't quite figure out how the torture device works, just that when some big screws are turned, he shrieks in pain. We get another look at Joffrey, who is trying on clothes for his wedding and the future Mrs. Joffrey, Margaery, is up to something. Joffrey continues his arrogant defiance of his mother and she is biding her time, knowing that this match is good, even thought she is highly suspicious of the girl. Tyrion is visited by his paramour and continues to warn her that his father will not hesitate to kill her for his own pleasure. He is in love and this could be a problem in the future. Peter Dinklage is excellent and is becoming more and more endearing as he is persecuted for being a rake and for things he can't control (his size/the death of his mother during childbirth). Margaery takes Sansa to see her mother and they discuss what Joffrey is really like. The mother is a tough cookie, and she tells Sansa that they can be trusted. What is said makes for an interesting future. The dragons are on the shelf for this episode, which is fine with me, although Dani's negotiations to secure an army to take her \"rightful\" place make it interesting.",

They are also informed about the fate of Winterfell and that Bran and Rickon are missing. Arya, Gentry and Hot Pie are captured by the Brotherhood and brought to an inn to eat and drink. But they also capture The Hound and Arya's identity is disclosed. Jaime lures Brienne and takes her spare sword and they fight on a bridge, but they are surprised by riders from the House of Bolton led by Locke. \"Dark Wings, Dark Words\" is another good episode where the viewer is introduced to the witty Lady Oleanna Tyrell and Sansa opens her heart. Will she regret for disclosing her true feelings? Is Oleanna a trustful person? So far, most of the nobles are despicable beings. Who is torturing Theon? What will happen with Brienne and Jaime? My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Dark Wings, Dark Words\"",

Jojen goes on to explain that both he and Bran are Wargs; people who can possess animals as well as seeing things that happened long ago, things that are happening far away and things yet to happen.Arya Stark and her two companions run into the Brotherhood without Banners; a group of warriors with no allegiance; it looks as if they will soon part company but on of their prisoners recognises Arya.Back in King's Landing Sansa meets Olenna Tyrell; the grandmother of King Joffrey's bride-to-be Margaery. She is asked what sort of person Joffrey is; for the first time she feels safe to give an honest answer: Joffrey is a monster.Elsewhere we see that things are going very badly for Theon Greyjoy, he is being tortured by unknown captors; Brienne and Jaime Lannister run into some trouble on their way to King's Landing and Jon Snow learns a bit more about Mance Rayder.This was an impressive episode that successfully introduced a surprising number of new characters. The appearance of Dame Diana Rigg was the most notable and she impressed as Olenna Tyrell; a character who appears to be strong and is likely to be more important as the series continues. Similarly the Brotherhood without Banners are intriguing and it will be interesting to see how important they will be to Arya's plot arc. While Jojen and Meesa aren't as immediately interesting they served to tell us more about Bran and go some way to explain his strange dreams. The scenes with Theon are a little unpleasant as he is tortured and has no idea why. As always the acting is impressive throughout and once it was over I wanted more.",

Gwendoline Christie and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau have a great chemistry and it is a joy to watch as their characters trade insults and argue. We get introduced some new characters, the introduction of Noah Taylor's Locke, is brief, but in our our first glimpse at the Brotherhood without Banners it proves a lot of fun. With Paul Kaye's Thoros of Myr, the writers have created a character that Kaye brings to vibrant life. There's something magnetic about Kaye's performance. But for me the introduction of Lady Olenna-the Queen of Thorns is the big one. Diana Rigg is a delight, I adore her.I have to say, I'm not loving the Bran storyline, it slows things down too much. not the fault of any of the actors, as they are all competent I also did not love the scene with Catelyn and Tulisa. Poor writing (I'm sure to give her character some sympathy) aside, it does not ring true, and was a mistake.The episodes ends on an appropriate cliffhanger that should keep viewers wanting to come back for more, but the pace needs to pick up a bit. don't get me wrong!! This is a perfectly solid episode, with some fine performances and moments, but it's never going to be classed among the best episodes of the show.",

The episode was slower and less thrilling then the first episode as most memorable scenes involved characters walking in the woods. Diana Rigg made her first appearance on the show as the witty and intelligent grandmother of Margarey making for a great scene between Lady Olenna Redwyne, Margarey and Sansa as they talk about the evil mind of Joffrey. The best monologue of the episode was given by Michelle Fairley as she talked about almost killing John because it was delivered in such an affecting way. The further we go through the series Joffrey becomes more uncontrollable and it is obvious from Cersei cannot control him anymore and is losing all of the power she once had. While weaker then the premiere episode it has set up many plots that will be seen throughout the season with Arya and The Houd coming back into each other's life's.EPISODE GRADE: B (MVP: Michelle Fairley)",

Even Arya gets a little more screen time as well and shines in her relationships with two of the slaves she befriended in Season 2.Overall, another great episode for the third season.",

                    "content": "Well it may have taken two episodes, but we've finally been reunited with the entire cast, and then some. Hopefully everyone's taking notes; it's going to get complicated.The title of this week's chapter: \"Dark Wings, Dark Words,\" is most likely an allusion to messages regarding a family death and the destruction of a familial home, received by Robb Stark early in the episode, but it aptly describes many of the events that befall the rest of the players in the game of thrones. While the previous installment seemed to have a much brighter tone, one of mostly triumphant returns, it's easy to see why certain characters' stories were saved for this somewhat grim episode full of torture, abductions, and the oh so punchable Joffrey (another form of torture). Game of Thrones as a series presents us with a world that is rarely black and white. Good people do bad things, and bad things happen to good people; in this way, the show has its emotional ups and downs, but twice as many downs. We're back to form here in an episode that mirrors the previous, only slightly gloomier.As we're reacquainted with Bran in the first scene, it becomes immediately apparent as he's walking and drawing his bow, this is a dream. In a poignant throwback to the series premiere, the young Stark boy is instructed by his older brothers on how to aim and fire his arrow, followed by the ethereal, disembodied voice of Ned, echoing his reassurance after Bran misses his mark. The familiar three-eyed raven he aimed for flies off, and Jojen Reed (played by Thomas Brodie-Sangster, recognizable to any Love Actually fans\u0085. guilty) reveals himself, explaining the nature of his dreams to an understandably confused Bran. Finally, it seems viewers are going to gain insight into the frequent and cryptic dream sequences that haunt Bran.Later, Catelyn receives a one-two punch of bad news from her son Robb: her father has died, and Winterfell has been sacked, leaving her two youngest boy's whereabouts unknown. Dark words indeed. While this scene is clearly meant to be devastating: a daughter mourning her father, a mother beside herself with worry for her children, and a young king grappling with meting justice to his own mother, it comes across as nearly impenetrable to any who aren't paying extremely close attention, or have read the books. It's a shame that this scene lacks the emotional punch it deserves due to over-complication, and weak explanation.To read the rest (IMDb form too short) visit: http://custodianfilmcritic.com/game-of-thrones- 3-2-dark-wings-dark-words/",

                    "content": "Last week's premiering episode of Season 3 saw a focused, visually stunning and epic return to our much loved Game of Thrones. Following would be a hard task so it is no surprise, therefore, that this week suffered a lull. A slightly confusing one at that. In this episode the focus is on every other character missed out last week and a return to King's Landing. Additionally, some new faces are added to the mix. That's right... more characters. Woven together in a mix-match of majoritively non-sensical jump cuts, each character arc across Westeros is covered. In the North, we return to Bran Stark and his younger brother Rickon on their journey to the wall, accompanied by Hodor and Osha. Bran is continuously having dreams, at first dismissed as black magic. However, after meeting Jojen and Meera Reed, the dreams hold more relevance. Jojen reveals to Bran they have been searching for him, believing him to play a critical role in the future. Child-toasting Theon Grayjoy has been taken captive by a group of unknown men. They torture him, asking questions regarding Winterfell. Despite answering truthfully, the torture continues. At a moments rest for Theon, a boy who claims to have been sent by his sister vows to come to his rescue at midnight. Brave sword-slinger Arya Stark and her two companions, Gendry and Hot Pie, remain on the run from Harenhaal. They come face to face with the Brotherhood without Banners, who offer them some hospitality. Whilst at their inn, big-man Sandor Clegane arrives as a captive and notices Arya. Upon seeing her, he reveals her identity to the entire brotherhood.Beyond the wall, Jon Snow experiences his first Warg \u2013 a man who is capable of seeing through the eyes of animals \u2013 and the Night's Watch remain on an exhausting trip back to their posts. King in the North Robb Stark receives letters revealing the death of his grandfather and the devastation that took place at Winterfell, resultant from Theon Grayjoy. He also discovers that Bran and Rickon have not been found. After telling his mother, Lady Stark, of the bad news, she then feels responsible for what has happened to them. In a way, my segmented summaries of each character trope are emblematic of the episode itself. It felt disjointed throughout, and ultimately not as engaging. However, I am by no means saying the quality is not there. Keeping consistent, each performance is great and entertaining, and the new characters this week were interesting additions, some with familiar faces (Mackenzie Crook was a nice surprise). The episode's greatest strengths for me, however, lied in King's Landing and Brienne of Tarth's escort of Jamie Lannister. If we remember, Brienne of Tarth was sent on a mission by Lady Stark to escort Jamie Lannister back to King's Landing, in the hope of exchanging him for Sansa and Arya. As both treck through various forestry, an unlikely latent chemistry develops. A slew of insults back and forth regarding the likes of one another's manliness provide this week's subtle output of comedy. Their dynamic also showcases some good old fashioned sword fighting action, in a delightfully refreshing clumsy and ungraceful manner. Yet, events in King's Landing again remain the most gripping, as manipulation is in abundance. Marjory Tyrell and her grandmother grill Sansa over the true nature of Joffrey, causing her to have a mini- breakdown. In an impressive turn by Sophie Turner, it is understated yet emotive, demonstrating the effects of Joffrey's torture and malice. Speaking of which, Joffrey continues to be a joy to watch, brilliantly playing the character that everybody loves to hate. Even better however, was Marjory's manipulation of him. Combing sensual flirtation and a knowing yet naive subservience has the wrongful king fooled. Better yet, it is no doubt the slow start of a progressing battle of feminine wills - newcomer Marjory vs. power-bitch Cersei. Nevertheless, episode 2 was neither as visually stimulating or engaging. Instead, it felt disjointed and overcrowded. Although, in typical Game of Thrones fashion these various character tid bits are still an entertaining watch and credit is due to the cast and crew for making it so. Still... for me, this week was just not as engrossing.",

She is a sly, witty and very astute women who practically leads Tyrells and is unlike any women we've seen in the series before. She and Margaery have their own schemes and they have already begun moving the pawns forward. I am sure they'll add more excitement to the show.On the whole, I like where this is going and I am excited for what may come.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Loved the previous two episodes, loved \"Walk of Punishment\" even more. There may be bigger and more epic episodes, but it is nonetheless as thrilling as the episodes that are those things and there is some boldness in \"Walk of Punishment\". Especially in the truly shocking final moments. Even when you know it's coming when it's spoiled for you before watching the episode, it is one of the most harrowing endings of the earlier seasons.My only real issue with \"Walk of Punishment\" is that the Arya and Hot Pie didn't interest me as much as everything else in the episode, some of it felt somewhat clumsy and didn't add very much. However, all the acting is great with the top honours going to the ever brilliant Peter Dinklage (who has yet to put a foot wrong) and a searingly intense Nikolaj Coster-Waldau. For a first-time directing job, this is a seriously impressive effort, what is so good about 'Game of Thrones' is a long way from diminished here. Visually, \"Walk of Punishment\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Walk of Punishment\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All in all, great episode if not quite a masterpiece. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Every storyline zings alone and keeps you caught up in the quality writing, great performances and witty characterisation. Jaime has the most important episode of the entire show - a real watershed moment - while the drama in Astapor and north of the wall is absolutely riveting. Great stuff, and long may it continue.",

She is willing to part with one of her dragons to get what she wants. The thing is she is the mother of dragons. Can she even strike such a bargain (if you get my drift). We will see. Lots of stuff in the woods as Arya goes on and the Pie Guy stays behind to be a baker. Theon is nearly killed but seems to have a guardian angel. This series is filled with near misses and last minute rescues. Jaime, his confidence overflowing, plays too much of his hand (so to speak) and pays dearly for it. His sliminess knows no bounds, but he should realize that he is playing fast and loose with a pack of barbarians. This is a fast moving, well constructed episode. Tyrion is there for comic relief this time. He is made \"Master of the Coin,\" which appears to be the treasurer. He says he doesn't know finance because he just spent money; he never kept track of it.",

Against the will of Jorah and Barristan, Daenerys buys 8,000 Unsullied soldiers and the slave translator Missandel giving her biggest dragon in return. Mance sends a small group to scale The Wall and attack Castle Black. Tywin summons the small council and names Tyrion as the new Master of Coin. Soon Tyrion finds that The Iron Throne has a great debt to the Iron Bank of Braavos. Theon is recaptured by his captors but a stranger saves him. Jaime and Brienne are prisoners of Locke and Jaime tries to convince him to let him go. Locke cuts his right hand off. \"Walk of Punishment\" shows Daenerys giving one of her beloved dragons for a slave-army. The cunning Tyrion has disclosed a dangerous financial situation to the Iron Throne. Jaime surprisingly save Brianne and now with a severed hand he will probably become more dangerous than never. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Walk of Punishment\"",

                    "content": "The title of this episode is an obvious reference to the 'Walk of Punishment' in the slaver city where Daenerys sees a row of men being crucified. After this walk we see her making a deal to buy all of the Unsullied\u0085 an army of eight thousand. They won't be cheap though; the price demanded is the largest of her three dragons! The title could also be taken as a somewhat less obvious reference to what is happening to Jaime and Brienne who have been captured by an unknown group whose intentions do not appear to be good and lead to the episode's shocking conclusion. Elsewhere we see Robb Stark and his mother attending her father's funeral where we learn that Roob's plans to lure the Lannister forces into an area of his choosing have been ruined by his uncle Edmure Tully's decision to launch an attack for an immediate victory. Back in the capital Tyrion has been made 'Master of Coin' and discovers that the state is heavily in debt to the sort of people who will quickly change sides if they don't think they will be repaid. We also see Theon being helped to escape from his torturers by an unknown man.This was another gripping episode with the usual intertwined narrative. It nicely mixes moments of comedy with some fairly shocking scenes. The comedy largely comes from Edmure Tully; as we are introduced to him he is attempting to shoot a flaming arrow into the boat containing his late father and misses three times. Tobias Menzies does a fine job playing this somewhat incompetent new character. There is further amusement after Tyrion rewards his squire by treating him to a trio of beautiful young ladies at the brothel and they refuse payment because he gave them such a good time! These amusing moments serve to make the disturbing moments all the more shocking; these include a scene where Theon is almost raped and the finale where Jaime learns that his smooth talking has not impressed his captors has much as he thought. While not as dramatic it will be interesting to see how Daenerys's deal will turn out. Overall another really good episode thanks to its mix of drama, unforced comedy and plot advancement.",

                    "content": "Off with his hand! Jaime, the great swordsman, provoked the wrong Northerner this time in Locke (Noah Taylor, ever the colorful skuzzy cretin), resulting in the chopping off of his right hand. As Locke says, \"Daddy isn't here now\". Nope, no help from Daddy Tywin, but he does do something meaningful for a change by convincing Locke not to allow Brienne of Tarth to be raped by telling him that her father has quite the weight in sapphire. There is this great acting piece with Michelle Fairley (I'm surprised her work wasn't rewarded with an Emmy in the third season) as her Lady Catelyn Stark speaks to her uncle, after reuniting (he had a thirty-year rift with her father, his brother, but was there when he died) about her father while looking out a window in their old castle. Blackfish, Brynden Turlly, and Cat share a warm scene where she appreciates seeing him again after his being frustrated with Edmore Tully (Tobias Menzies) for choosing to take a Mill (which gifted them to relative Lannisters but not much else) instead of engaging Clegane at Harrenhal, losing 208 men in the process. Tywin sitting at a table, having invited \"The Circle\" (which includes Varys, Littlefinger, Pycelle, Cersei, and at the end of the table, Tyrion) to sit with him, wanting word on Jaime, decides to further belittle Tyrion by giving him the role of Master of Coin, to handle the finances of the Iron Throne/Kingdom. Cersei has a big grin at her father's dressing him down. After Tyrion, in previous episode, is raked across the coals by Tywin for requesting Casterly Rock, which included reminding him of how he \"ripped himself\" out of his mother's womb, killing her, and embarrassing him (also bothered that he can't claim Tyrion isn't his son), giving him such a lowly role within the family just elaborates his disregard for him. Robb's Queen sees to the Lannister kids, diffusing their concerns about him \"eating the skins of his enemies\"...Tywin no longer labors against Robb on the battlefield, as he is now essentially the most powerful man in Westeros. As Daenerys confronts Ser Jorah and Barriston Selmy (bragging about how her ancestor Rhaegor was a great warrior, the \"last dragon\", with Daenerys reminding him that he isn't the last dragon...) about challenging her decision to trade her biggest dragon for 8000 slaves (which included his translator, the gorgeous Nathalie Emmanuel, as Missandei) in front of the slave trader at Astapor. I see why Daenerys is so loved by GoT fans...the way she carries herself in the episode, offering the crucified slave (desiring freedom) water, making sure her two advisers remember she isn't to be questioned during negotiation, and her pride in being treated with respect as being a woman doesn't negate her abilities as a leader, as she will prove time and again. Jaime can cast all his quips and jest to his heart's content, but eventually chains and a prison, Brienne's swordplay and Cat's willingness to free him in order to hopefully get her daughters, won't stop the dangers of Westeros from catching up to him. Samwell gets to endure Craster's remarks on his hefty size for amusement while Lord Commander Jeor Mormont sits quiet, as talk of his use as \"good meat\" eventually becomes too harsh to tolerate. And there is this incredible visual sequence where the severed heads of horses once ridden by the Night's Watch officers are left in a dagger shape on the snow as Mance Rayder prepares for eventual combat while Jon Snow is party to their battle plans. For humor, Pod, the servant who saved Tyrion's life when Stannis and his forces failed to take King's Landing, is \"rewarded\" by Tyrion with prostitutes at Littlefinger's bordello...the punchline...the girls were so impressed and pleased with Pod, they returned Tyrion's gold to him! With Theon trying to escape through help from a mysterious dungeon sweeper who is also a marksmen with a bow, Cat weeping about never seeing her girls again, and a mishap with Edmure's arrow skills missing Cat's father's corpse boat in a funereal fire ceremony.",

                    "content": "This week's episode of Game of Thrones felt a much better improvement on last week's affair. We continue with each character trope, both of great and small significance, but with better pacing and intermittent moments of pure brilliance, crafted by the collective genius of David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. Things aren't going particularly well for the Stark family to say the least. Not only is Robb mourning the loss of his grandfather, he still does not know the whereabouts of his brothers Bran and Rickon and is now having to deal with his uncle's (Edmure) bad decisions. Edmure sacrificed men in the kidnapping of two Lannister cousins, both of whom do not hold much worth in the act of competition against the Lannister family. Robb expresses his dissatisfaction, declaring they cannot afford to sacrifice men, especially against Tywin Lannister. Speaking of whom, in King's Landing Tywin holds a meeting with the small council. Cersei sits loyally by her father, not saying a word, nor having to as her facial expressions speak far louder. As a clear act of defiance, Tyrion moves his chair to the other side of the table. The lack of dialogue make it a wonderfully comical and poignant moment, continuing to prove that at the very least, Tyrion is the rightful king of wit and wonderful performativity. He is also, as a result from the meeting, the new Master of Coin. Elsewhere in King's Landing, other than seeking advice from an ever creepy and suspicious Littlefinger, Tyrion treats his squire to a visit from not one, not two, but several prostitutes as a thank you for saving his life. Contrasting the previous weeks in which sex and nudity has been relatively tame for the show, this week showcased naked women, one of whom had no shyness in demonstrating her flexibility. Problematic objectification of women? One could most definitely argue yes. But on the other hand, however, we have a character like Daenerys \u2013 a strong willed female, purchasing 8000 slaves and causing two rugged men to compete for her approval. In response to the phrase, \"Valar Morghulis\" (meaning all men must die), she replies \"yes, but we are not men\". This paradoxical portrayal of women is atypical of Game of Thrones but is a debate only served justice in an article of its own right. It just felt that the objectified vs. almost-feminist paradox was particularly prescient this week. Mance Rayder and his men, including Jon Snow, come across the patterned remnants of an attack from the White Walkers. The only corpses apparent, however, are those of horses, causing them to question where the Nights Watch are and if they're even alive. Mance decides to send a crew of 20 men to the wall, including Jon Snow. He wants to create the biggest conflagration the North has ever seen. Remaining members of the Nights Watch continue their long march back to the wall. They take shelter at Craster's Keep \u2013 the oppressive home of misogyny and sacrificing baby boys. Theon Grayjoy is released from torture and captivity as promised, and sent away on a horse. He is eventually found, however, and is chased down by his captors in a brilliantly choreographed, intense sequence. Theon is once again saved by the man who released him, as he skilfully (and quite brutally) shoots down each person.Arya and Gendry continue travelling with the Brotherhood without Banners, but Hot Pie decides to stay and serve as a baker. Queue a brief but heartfelt goodbye and a nice moment of childhood innocence, most welcome amidst the adult ethical and moral issues. Jaime and Brienne remain captured by the men of House Tully. At night time, as Jaime had warned, the men take Brienne away to rape her. At first she is beaten, with Brienne fighting back every step of the way. Taking place off camera, Brienne's screams cause a glimmer of humanity in Jamie as he looks rueful. In typical Lannister fashion, he uses his charm and promises a plentiful of wealth if both himself and Brienne are returned unharmed and undefiled. Brienne is saved and we are led to believe that so too is Jaime. However, the leader of House Tully is disgusted by his charm and use of family wealth and proceeds to chop of Jaime's hand. Queue end credits and the most random choice of musical accompaniment, so abruptly exporting us away from Westeros back in to the real world I thought my Itunes had sporadically booted up. As Game of Thrones so typically does, this week was once again a fragmented mix of each character trope \u2013 some more entertaining than others. Overall, however, the pacing felt far better and as a result, made the episode much more captivating. The little things also made all the difference, such as a moment of childlike innocence, a well orchestrated chase sequence or a cleverly crafted pattern of horse corpses. Although this week's particular highlight was once again in King's Landing, via Tyrion's comical act of loudly dragging the chair across a silent meeting room \u2013 a standout moment... that, and a blunt ending.",

It was just...STUPID!!! Last season I hated the liberties D.B. and Benioff took with Tyrion....and in tonight's episode, they took the liberties to a whole new level....I know that this is a TV Series, but it's based on marvelous book series, and who is perhaps the best character in the books? TYRION! D.B. and Benioff should know that, and they should also know that perhaps more than half of the viewers have already read the books....THEY MUST STOP THIS LIBERTIES THEY TAKE WITH TYRION!!!On the other hand, the episode was fantastic, perhaps because of the scenes of Dany, Robb/Catelyn, and Jaime/Brianne, although the ending was a little weak....an event as big as Jaime loosing his hand should have had more drama to it....Still, I can't shake this feeling that although this was a not-so-good episode, I really enjoyed it.",

Jaime- Brienne events and the way they shortened it without loosing too much on the essence.3. Dany is Astapor is strictly aligned to books and can't wait for the next thing to happen (which every book-reader knows).4. Riverrun events are also quite close to book and better handled.Disliked: 1. A big no for Tyrion-Podrick brothel scenes, don't know what they were trying to do with this... must have been avoided.2. Emotional scene between Arya and Hotpie, I with huge plot line to cover they shouldn't add these unnecessary scenes.3. Where is that red woman going (to iron islands I guess !!)....",

Meanwhile it's heartening to see another actor from the cast of HBO's Rome introduced: Tobias Menzies as Catelyn's brother, Edmure Tully.There are also some powerful emotional scenes, spectacularly acted and directed.I especially loved Tyrion and Pod's antics in this episode. In a TV show all about war and death, the lightheartedness is a welcome relief.Altogether a great episode. Can't wait for the next one!",

And in the book I kind of felt like aw, she's protecting Jamie, that's nice because he is fearful because he can not fight back well at all since he lost his hand earlier in the book. I think it was a great episode! But then again, we didn't see anything on Bran, Rickon, Osha, Hodor, Jojen, Meera, Sansa, Shae, Joffrey, Margaery, Loras or Oleanna at all in this episode, I thought it was odd. But very intense.

Content aside, the editing of the final seconds of footage is completely infuriating. It breaks immersion and totally ruins the episode. I recommend watching the final seconds of the show on mute as it will be a much more enjoyable experience. The audio sounds like it was edited by a 10 year old who wanted to put his favourite song in the show so everyone would know how cool it was. The song was actually a good choice and the connection to the start of the episode was a nice touch. Cutting off the final pieces of dialogue however was an amateur mistake that was a fire-able offence.I have decided to stick to the books from now on!",

                    "content": "Walk of Punishment is GoTs writer David Benioff's directorial debut, and it is obvious.First off, why would you decide to let someone direct for the first time on an episode of one of the most brilliant and popular shows of present time? While I was watching it I couldn't help but to think that HBO has lost the essence of the characters which I would have thought impossible considering George R.R. Martin is supervising the entire thing. The first scene that comes to mind is when Daenerys is speaking to the slaver about the terms of the trade. In the story she is supposed to be fooling the slaver by offering him her dragons, but in the show, Jorah is fooled by her too and quite startled. So we, as the viewer, are either supposed to think that Jorah is very dense, or we are supposed to believe Dany suddenly doesn't care about her dragons any more than gold. The scene made no sense, the way Jorah reacted would clearly indicate that something's up and alert the slaver.The scene where Hot Pie says his goodbyes to everyone is another scene showing bad directing, the way it was drawn out was so clumsy and awkward, and when Arya and Gendry are riding off, Arya turns and yells \"Hot Pie!\" Young Arya, the clever and spunky girl had one more important thing to tell Hot Pie: the bread is really good! Wait... who said that? That couldn't have been Arya. I mean with the kinda stuff that this little girl has seen, you might expect her to say, \"stay safe!\" or \"keep your head on!\" The scene should have probably just been canned. This really is trivial to the story but it just seemed so out of line with her personality! What show is this!? Not just Arya that seems to be unfamiliar but also Jaime. The character holds onto his \"Lannistery\" sense of entitlement nicely, but the circumstances surrounding him are bad enough that he should definitely seem far more bitter than he acts.Tyrion's banter with other characters isn't quite on point either, the scene with him and Littlefinger was underwhelming to say the least. But there are more naked girls than before in this episode; this time around GoT seems to be more concerned about pleasing those who watch this show for it's lusty appeal.It's not all bad though, the character Robb Stark delivers a great tongue lashing to the ignorant knight that fails to obey his orders. Catelyn Stark is done wonderfully as well. The scenes north of the wall thankfully have not fallen in quality either.I'm not saying Mr. Benioff is doing anything to hurt the story, which is progressing nicely, is just seems like the delivery is seriously lacking. The show needs to be tweaked hear and there to fit the important things into an hour, but changing the character's personalities is not something that should ever happen.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"And Now His Watch is Ended\" has often been lauded as the best episode of Season 3. Have to agree with this, certainly better than the previous still great episodes. While \"And Now His Watch is Ended\" may not be one's definition of action-packed, the themes of revenge and betrayal have very rarely been this enthralling, even when character and dialogue-heavy. Up to this point in the season, it is the tightest paced, where things felt fully settled, in terms of introducing new characters and advancing older characters and subplots, and the most emotionally complex. \"And Now His Watch is Ended\" starts in a way that carries on from the end of the previous episode \"Walk of Punishment\" and reminds us of that ending's shock value, and the brutal shocks, emotional complexities and surprises keep coming. Right up until the highlight of not just the episode, but of the season, the mind-blowing ending with Daenerys, now a character you don't want to under-estimate.While the acting is superb across the board, the biggest mention has to go to Emilia Clarke, up to this point it was her best acting on the show and still holds up as one of her finest hours.Visually, \"And Now His Watch is Ended\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"And Now His Watch is Ended\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.To conclude, truly phenomenal episode, worth seeing for Daenerys' final scene alone but everything still works with nothing that one would change. Season 3's best and a 'Game of Thrones' highlight. Didn't want it to end. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

There are torrid twists and turns galore, plenty of shocking moments, and real intrigue and excitement between the characters. It says something that Margery's handling of Joffrey is just as satisfying as Daenerys teaching the slave trader a lesson. An opulent episode with the incident at Craster's keep being perhaps one of the most shocking of the entire show.",

And, ultimately, we see Dany asserting her authority, working a system and playing on the idea of freedom. Meanwhile, Jaime has been abused to the nth degree. He has been forced to drink horse urine and shoved in the mud. But his companion brings back a possibility of dignity for him. It's interesting how those who were despicable can pull at our hearts when their adversaries prove even worse. Cersai is up to no good and tries to gain some modicum of respect. She will endure.

Joffrey shows The Great Sept of Baelor to Margaery and Cersei realizes that Margaery has Joffrey under control. Then she meets her father and tells that she is worried since Margaery is manipulating Joffrey. Varys meets Oleanna and they have a long conversation about Sansa. The Margaery meets Sansa and she tells that they would be sisters if Sansa married her brother Loras. The Hound is judged by The Brotherhood without Banners through a trail by combat. Theon is led by the youngsters that saved him to meet his sister Yara in a dark chamber and soon he finds that his escape was another sadistic means of torturing him. Lord Commander Mormont tries to calm down his men that are starving but one of them kills Craster and another one stabs Mormont on the back killing him. Sam flees with Gilly and her son through the frozen woods. Daenerys has a surprising attitude toward Kraznys mo Nakloz and leaves Astapor with her dragons and the army. In \"And Now His Watch Is Ended\", the arrogant Jaime is humiliated by his captors. Varys explains to Tyrion that revenge Is a dish best served cold. Theon is receiving what he deserves and it was good to see him back to the chamber of torture. The situation outside The Wall seems to be out of control with the murder of Lord Commander Mormont. But the best part of the show is Daenerys attitude in Astapor. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"And Now His Watch Is Ended\"",

                    "content": "After the shocking end to the previous episode, where Jaime Lannister lost his sword hand we see him as a much weaker man; there is no more banter; he knows that his fate is entirely in the hands of his captors; Brienne tries to encourage him but he doesn't appear to be listening. Things aren't going well for Theon either; his rescuer tells him that he is going to be taken to his sister when in fact he is taking him back to his cell and further torture; his escape was nothing more than a cruel ploy to give him hope before taking it away. Back in King's Landing Tyrion visits Lord Varys to ask if his sister is still trying to kill him and hears the story of what happened to Varys when he was younger. Later Varys schemes with Olenna Tyrell to ensure that Lord Baelish doesn't get Sansa Stark. North of the wall tensions rise at Craster's camp to the point that members of the Night's Watch turn on him and each other. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys buys her Army of the Unsullied\u0085 and their previous owner gets quite a surprise!This episode was great even by the high standards of this series. It started well, if somewhat downbeat, with Jaime's humiliation at the hands of his captors then got increasingly better. Lord Varys's story was somewhat disturbing but one couldn't help smile when we learn of his ongoing revenge against the man responsible for his suffering as a child. The events that take place in Craster's camp were sudden, violent and led to one surprising death\u0085 and another that was not so surprising. The highlight though was the purchase of the Unsullied\u0085 which came just as I was thinking we wouldn't be seeing Daenerys this episode. When she agreed to give up one of her dragons I feared that it would ultimately prove to be a mistake but it was hard not to cheer as Daenerys first showed that she understands Valyrian, so understood every insult directed at her, then orders the Unsullied to kill the slavers\u0085 just as their seller learns that dragons aren't something one can own. The acting was solid throughout; Emilia Clarke as Daenerys and Conleth Hill as Varys were particularly impressive. Overall a thrilling episode that, to use a clich\u00e9, is a real emotional roller-coaster.",

                    "content": "And Now His Watch Is Ended certainly finished with a riveting visual of the freed Unsullied slave army leaving the burning, slave city, as those who whipped them and treated them as possessions to order around (including the sleazy, demeaning slave trader, Kraznys mo Nakloz (Dan Hildebrand)) are left as corpses. Kraznys, in particular, soon realizes that the deal he made with Daenerys doesn't go as he expected, with the \"best dragon she has\" burning him alive as she informs him that it isn't a slave. But for the most part, this episode will leave a bad taste considering all the sadism. You see that the sweeper of the torture chamber who \"helped Theon escape\" leads him around and back to the same castle that had been where his foot was driven in with a twisting vice while body blows remained consistent. Who is this sadist? Could he be Roose Bolton's bastard? Gaining his trust, this sadist listens to Theon go on and on about his drama as the boy raised by Ned while wanting to prove loyalty to his father, soon led right back to his torture chamber unknowingly. Why would he go through so much effort? Is it all a game? And Jaime, his severed hand slumped over his chest from a leather rope as a reminder of what he's lost, his face worse for wear, without water or food, on a horse he soon falls from despite Brienne's requests to the Northerners, led by the gleaming Locke (reveling in his hostage's misery). Once off the horse, Locke offers him horse piss in a canteen while kicking him around in horse manure mud, the Northern soldiers mocking him as he tries to use a taken sword to fight with his weak hand. Brienne eventually confirms what we already knew...the \"sapphire\" was for blue water not riches. So Jaime uncharacteristically helped someone. Brienne returns the favor by scolding him for just wanting to die, reminding him that this is just the first bit of suffering he truly has had to endure; something taken from him is quite new to him. Cersei wants to know if her father is trying to locate Jaime, and Tywin reminds her that he started a war when Tyrion was kidnapped, so if he would do that for a son he doesn't care for he sure would do everything in his power to rescue his heir. Cersei, though, wants his approval because she feels out of all his children, she is the one who listened to him the most and wants him to do something about the Tyrells. She doesn't like that Margaery has her \"claws\" in Joffrey. Tywin assures her that he will keep Joffrey in line. Margaery, to her credit, has seduced and manipulated Joffrey quite a bit, such as building his favor with those in his kingdom, listening to him and encouraging, warm and positive with every historical fact Joffrey gladly offers her as they walk about the Iron Throne and its halls. She even goes to Sansa (Margaery's mother also has an interest in Ned Stark's daughter, as her conversation with Lord Varys soon indicates) during prayer to have a chat about marrying her brother and being queen of Highgarden. Margaery does have quite an adversary in Cersei as Cersei is more than displeased with how Joffrey has become such a puppet on her string. But the title of the episode refers to something Lord Commander Mormont says as they speak over the burning body of a Night's Watchman; this coming before his own men turn on him due to how Caster, at his keep, had treated them. Caster has went out of his way to make sure they feel unwelcome, offering his place, as a wildling \"ally\" of Lord Mormont, his home with all his wives (many his daughters he makes other girls with), but not without scorn to the Night's Watch, outside The Wall. Craster sees that the men appear ready to strike so he goes at one of their members and gets a dagger through his face while Lord Commander Mormont is stabbed by sword from behind, eventually succumbing to his injuries while another of his own men stabs him repeatedly. Craster's Keep becomes a zone of chaos as supporters of Lord Commander Mormont duel with those that turned against him. And Samwell, with Gilly (and her male baby), scurry away as they are warned that once found their throats would be slit. A ton of dark subject matter permeates throughout this entire episode. Perhaps the most memorable features Tyrion getting some alone time with Lord Varys as he explains to him his castration experience and the sorcerer who burned his privates in flames as a voice reached out from within the fire. This has left Varys repulsed with any magician. He moves about furniture and opens a wooden plank to reveal to Tyrion the sorcerer, proving to him that revenge is possible. Varys and his many spies are often of topic when he speaks to others, and the series continues to reveal more and more about him, while he is still quite enigmatic in what is his true motives and plans. He is certainly not a fan of Littlefinger gaining access to Sansa and becoming too powerful, particularly since he's off to the Eyrie to make Lady Aryn his wife. Whether Olenna and Cersei speak about trying to keep their sons from dying in war, Olenna opining roses as an image of valor or her barbs with Varys; Diana Rigg is a treasure on the show. As far as the Stark children go: Arya is still with the Brotherhood with No Banners, pledging their allegiance to the fire god, as Beric Dondarrion emerges from the shadows of a cavern to declare doom on The Hound for his murders of Targ babies (he dismisses outright) while Arya calls him out for killing her little friend, Bran continues to dream of his ability to walk while chasing the raven, climbing a tree with mother trying to get him to promise her he won't climb anymore.",

It's true most of it is set up but the way it's handled you know it's going to me something big will happen soon, actually something does in the end which I'll get to.Really liked some of that conversation between Margaery's mom (forgot her name) and Cercei. I kinda like what Margaery's mom disagreement on the world belonging to the young, I don't believe that either. Youth alone is nothing compared to wisdom and experience. Cercei of course tries to defend her point but she can see Margaery's mom kinda has the upper hand on her, in a way it shows that Cercei isn't the only game player in town. We see that more when we see Margaery is clearly manipulated Jofery, it shows that Margaery's true aim is to rule even if it means bending Jofery will to her own.We even see the Watch descending in the ranks in one scene, I really like seeing Sam actually being human and doing what he should be doing in the first place, not just guard a damn wall all day and night (what the hell do most of the time anyway?) he helps a woman he loves. In a way I can't help but feel it a slight hint that may'be The Watch isn't totally honorable there may be some corruption brewing but what Sam did I felt that an example showing the importance of having a life.However the highlight of the episode no doubt is with Davenerys, the last scene where just beautiful, knowing her I knew she had an ace up her sleeve and she plays that card well. We see her sell off her dragon to get the army she needs and then comes a great moment when the blowhole slave master says something offensive to her. She then turns around and you can tell from that vicious look she understood what he said, and we see that she's all this time not just understood but can speak the native tongue perfectly.That speech she gives was just amazing, in a way it's my own feelings toward slavery. And I just couldn't help but cheer as she began the attack when we see her solders slay all of the slave masters and dictators in their path. As well as see her pet dragon go to town or should I say cook the town.It just goes to show just like the dragons she mothers, Davenerys is truly strong and in that last shot of her marching army she is growing stronger.Rating: 4 stars",

I have loved seeing Daenerys's growth from frightened and abused and childlike to this fierce warrior who is also a strong, compassionate woman bent not only on conquering, but also on justice. The Mother of Dragons indeed!",

There are a lot of scenes that just seem to fill up time and space. I have no time for platitudes. Make something happen. These long line of people walking through the forest, stopping from time to time to exchange philosophical thoughts do not entertain me. I want action. Like there was in the first two seasons. Then it seemed like I was glued to the TV because it was so captivating. I think that the way series are marked on IMDb encourages that kind of \"coasting on reputation\" some shows are doing. GOT sits at a comfortable 9.4 as I write this. I think the score stands for the first two seasons. But the third is, at best, a 6.3. I am sorry. Get interesting, stop with the empty dialogs that go nowhere and give us some action!",

                    "content": "This series of Game of Thrones has continuously proved its status as the epitome of quality television. Whilst the majority of each instalment includes a variety of characters walking places, with the occasional sword fight thrown in, it is the visual flare, quality dialogue and top notch performances that captivate us audiences each week. Episode four remains very much the same as each character trope is once again developed that bit further. However, you know that recurring feeling of expectancy? Of a moment or event that such development is undoubtedly building toward? Well let's just say it has begun. Across Westeros, Jaime and Brienne continue to be abused and tormented by their captors, Jaime more so through a variety of trickery (horse wee anyone?). You have to admire his gusto, however, for attempting to fight back even in his handless and famished state. Something worth greater admiration though, is the development in Jaime and Brienne's relationship, which has undoubtedly progressed into levels of compassion and care. One moment sees both characters sit by the fire and Jaime melodramatically declare he is ready for death. Brienne effectively tells him to 'man up' and eat something. He begrudgingly chews on a bread roll. It is a wonderful sequence and proves that in a time of peril they have become closer - a surprisingly touching motif. Elsewhere, Theon is fooled by his 'rescuer'. Believing to be escorted back to his sister, he is instead taken straight back to where he was tortured \u2013 his father's castle. This roundabout journey provides a moment of discourse in which Theon shows remorse for his actions (primarily the murder of two orphans) and effectively admits a latent desire to be a true Stark boy, but disparagingly knows this will never be the case.We briefly touch upon Arya and her journey with the Brotherhood without Banners. Herself and Gendry are taken to their secret cave and meet the leader, Beric Dondarrion. He accuses Hound (their captive) of being a murderer, but charges cannot effectively be proved so a sword fight to the death is settled upon.The Nights Watch at Craster's Keep continue to moan and deploy bitterness at Craster, who has appointed them slaves and withdrawn any sense of hospitality. Just when you thought this act was beginning to get a bit tedious, members of the Nights Watch speak up and Craster is brutally murdered, in addition to the Nights Watch leader. It is a welcomed uprising and a refreshing portrayal of the Nights Watch who up until this point have not proved to be a particularly threatening group.In King's Landing, Tyrion is keen to get to the bottom of his attempted assassination at the Blackwater battle. He seeks advice from Lord Varys, who in turn offers a personal parable describing his own tale of revenge, the conclusion of which alludes to a \"good things come to those who wait\" sentiment. Elsewhere, Lord Varys seeks council from Grandmother Tyrell regarding the plans of Littlefinger. Until this point, his actions have been subdued, his presence almost non-existent. However, for the first time in this episode, we get a sense of the trouble that may lie ahead. Littlefinger has proposed a plan to help Sansa Stark escape King's Landing. This, of course, is part of a greater and more selfish motive. If Robb Stark falls as King of the North, Sansa is next in line and this is something Littlefinger aims to be a part of. As voiced by Lord Varys, \"He would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes\". This moment of discourse is particularly captivating primarily due to the quality dialogue and strong performances. Although brief, the sense of threat is effectively translated. Margaery Tyrell is forever at her manipulating ways, feeding to Joffrey's ego (he exudes minimal douche-ness this week) and courting friendship with Sansa. Cersei confesses her disliking of such actions to her father, Tywin, but does not receive the response she had hoped for. Once again, Charles Dance manages to steal a sequence with quality deliverance, perfecting the role of harsh and neglecting father. Compared to previous weeks, however, King's Landing does not boast the episode's top scene or most brilliant moment. That trophy is most definitely awarded to Daenerys and her actions in Astapor. Daenerys approaches Kraznys, dragon in tow, to partake in the agreed exchange. She hands over her dragon and in return, gets the golden whip providing mastery over the 8000 Unsullied. Once the deal is done, Daenerys tests her new powers in giving the first command to her newly purchased army. In doing so, she reveals she can in fact speak Valyrian. Whilst half expected, the impact of this twist was by no means less effective. In a pure moment of bad-assery, Daenerys commands her dragon to burn Kraznys and orders the Unsullied to kill every armed man in the castle. She instigates an Unsullied uprising. Proceeding this, she offers freedom to the Unsullied, declaring no one will be harmed if they wish to leave. Alternatively, she suggests they stay and fight for her but as free men. It is a risky move but one that ultimately pays off as each member of the Unsullied declare their commitment to their new leader. The episode thus ends on an epic scale (showcasing some top visual effects), as Daenerys marches off with three un-chained dragons and 8000 men in tow. You go girl. This week's episode flew by, ever-proving the strength of the show's strong dialogue and performances - each small taster per narrative strand shines. The fragmented character trope approach each week is also completely understandable, as the ten minute pay-offs on a sheer epic scale, as we have now sampled, are thus all the more impactful and effective. Things are definitely beginning to heat up and that feeling of anticipation is now increasingly stronger.",

Every scene (perhaps except for Tyrion/Varys) was excellent!!I make the exception for Tyrion/Varys scene because it started very well, Varys telling Tyrion his story of how he was castrated, but ended bad when Varys showed he already had captured the magician.... Not only did I didn't enjoy it because it is not in the books, but because it makes the scene, mainly Varys' dialogue, loose impact. But every other scene was so good damn good!!! Dialogue-wise, the best scenes where Cersei/Tywin and Lady Olenna/Varys. One could really enjoy the acting, mostly Dianna Rigg's, but all the actors and actresses really know how to get into their characters. Also, D.B. Weiss and D. Benioff where wise enough to give us a scene of almost every character.But my highlight (and I think everybody's) was the episode finale, starting with Craster's Keep, ending in Astapor.The development of the scene in Craster's Keep was spectacular, from the tense atmosphere to the catalystic act of the Black Brothers.And then...that gorgeous, marvelous, beautifully crafted scene of Astapor... I was really astonished by the level of production and the awesome special effects they used. In a nutshell, of this episode, all I can say is: PERFECT!",

It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Kissed by Fire\" may not quite be the season, and show, high-point that is the previous episode \"And Now His Watch is Ended\". It is regardless another great episode to a season that, up to this point, is as good as any of the consistently very good to outstanding episodes of the previous two seasons. It may be more characterisation and character interaction heavy than action-oriented and may lack the big revelations of the previous episodes, and is not as tightly paced and complex as especially \"And Now His Watch is Ended\". As 'Game of Thrones' is incredibly good at how it characterises its characters and how they interact this is a long way from a problem. This is apparent in \"Kissed By Fire\", especially in the touching interaction between Jaime and Brienne and the hugely intriguing Lannister stuff. Uniformly the acting is superb, especially from a moving Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Maisie Williams shining in Arya's Brotherhood scenes.Visually, \"Kissed By Fire\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Kissed By Fire\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Overall, Season 3 delivers again. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The emphasis here is on character growth, from Daenerys as newly-won conqueror to Jaime exploring his hitherto unnoticed human side. The scenes with a tortured Robb are particularly engrossing here, among the darkest the show gets, while the plotting in King's Landing is delightful with Charles Dance at the top of his game once more. Meanwhile, the sword fight between the Hound and Beric is one of the best-choreographed of the entire series.",

During a time in a bath, talking to Brienne, he reveals that what he did was actually noble, but that Stark had no interest in hearing his side of the story. He is a complex, multi-dimensional character. There is another supernatural element at work here, as well (for me, the less magic and non-earthly things, the better) with the revivification of the leader of the no banners group and the Hound. John Snow is finally seduced and it turns out that he is quite a lover. He is now fully embraced in his new life with his new people. The most intriguing plot development has to do with Tyrion and Cersei, who are now to be used as pawns to join certain factions in the war, and to squelch the efforts of one group to create a marriage of convenience politically. This sets up a whole raft of possibilities. Meanwhile, Dany has made all her new soldiers free men, and, in the process, attained great loyalty from them. They will be great fighters because they are like automatons. I'm looking forward to the next installment.",

Robb's sense of justice has brought losses to him. The mysterious Lord of Light is powerful and revives Dondarrion that is killed in combat by The Hound. But the Machievellian Tywin uses Cersei's poison to makes arrangements for the marriage of his children. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Kissed by Fire\"",

                    "content": "This episode sees The Hound face trial by combat but the result is not the one Arya had hoped for. North of the wall Jon Snow still isn't fully trusted by the Wildlings but after telling them about the defences at the wall Ygritte takes him to a cave where Jon breaks his vow never to lie with a woman\u0085 and he even manages to teach the more experienced Ygritte a thing or two. Robb Stark's plans face further setbacks when Lord Karstark and his men murder the two young Lannister boys; Robb has the killers executed but that leads to Karstark's forces departing leaving Robb with only half the men he had before; if he is to get more men he will have to have the Freys ally with him; something that won't be easy given that he broke his vow to marry Lord Frey's daughter. Back in King's Landing we learn that Loras Tyrell, the man it is suggested that Sansa marries, prefers the company of men and when Tywin Lannister learns of the proposed union he has other ideas about who Sansa and Loras should marry\u0085 somewhat to the dismay of his own children. Elsewhere Brienne and Jaime are handed over to Lord Bolton; here their treatment improves and after Jaime's wounds are treated he has a conversation with Brienne in which he gives the details about why he killed the 'Mad King'; details that make him a more sympathetic character.This was another fine episode which got of to a great start with The Hound's trial; it was an exciting fight made all the more impressive by his opponent's flaming sword. Arya's reaction to what was happening made it even more interesting; Maisie Williams was great here and in the scenes that followed. The scenes between Kit Harington and Rose Leslie, as Jon and Ygritte, were impressive and despite the nudity didn't feel gratuitous partially because it seemed entirely natural but also because his breaking of his vow is an important step to him joining the Wildlings. After all the scheming involving Tyrion and Cersei it was interesting to see their reaction to their father's demands; Tyrion's honourably reaction and Cersei's disgust! What ultimately happens to Sansa will be interesting to see. The scenes between Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Gwendoline Christi, as Jaime and Brienne, were surprisingly touching as Jaime tells the story about the Mad King's death. There are plenty of other great moments including a scene where Daenerys gives the Unsullied the right to choose their own names and one where Stannis visits his wife then his young daughter. All these scenes are combined in a way that leaves the viewer keen to discover what will happen next to the protagonists without feeling that any one scene goes on for too long. Overall another gripping episode.",

                    "content": "As each episode does, \"Kissed by Fire\" covers a hell of a lot within its running time. I laughed the other day when there was discussion about how certain GoT fans were angered at the first few episodes of the 8th season not running at film time. 52 minutes of this episode covers as much as a chapter in a book and doesn't need 30 more minutes.Cersei just enjoys it when Tywin passes down commandment to Tyrion, taking great delight in each humiliation. When told to marry Sansa with Tyrion protesting that she deserves better than all the misery already passed down to her, Cersei can't smile wide enough, knowing that Margaery's plan to have the Tyrells and Starks wed. But Tywin has plans for her, too-to marry Ser Loras-so that she could be aligned to the Tyrells and Highgarden. Cersei's own disagreement with this, much like Tyrion, leaves no impact as Tywin demands they bring respect to the name finally. Sansa could have chosen to ship away with Littlefinger (to have a Stark daughter would have been ideal for him as Varys understands all too well) but decided to heed Margaery's advice and remain at King's Landing, hoping to wed Loras (who is all too happy to bed a squire instead). Tywin doesn't want Olenna and Margaery to have an edge over the Lannisters, so his children are to make sure to secure power as he demands. Joffrey might be named King, but the Hand is the one calling the shots, it seems.Robb Stark is losing the faith of his men, as Cat's release of Jaime left him quite vulnerable, as Lord Karstark led a siege upon the Lannister boys, killing them in retaliation for the murder of his son thanks to Jaime. Robb has those responsible hung and Lord Karstark beheaded (Robb does the chopping, supposedly as a matter of procedure for betrayal). And the gulp in the throat: Robb sees a possible way towards seizing Casterly Rock through the aid of Walder Frey. The Red Wedding is fast approaching. You can see here where Lady Catelyn and her \"King of the North\" (no longer leaving such an intimidating sheen) son have gradually brought upon themselves their own doom.So it does appear the God of Fire does have serious potency...Beric Dondarrion, with his flaming sword, does give The Hound a good swordfight but the hulking swordsman gets the better of him. However, with but a few magic words from his drunk companion in the Brotherhood, Beric once again revives. The catch: Beric carries the scars of each death, a little less himself each time. Arya looks into a fire, inside the cavern, fuming over Beric letting The Hound free, wanting him dead for the loss of her friend by his hand. After the loss of Hotpie, who remained to cook in an inn, Gendry also decides to remain with the Brotherhood to be a smith to repair their metal.Speaking of the God of Fire, the wife, Lady Selyse (Tara Fitzgerald), of Stannis is praying to it when he arrives to visit her, needing to confess his affair with Melisandre. But Selyse is okay with it because she gave him a son. Stannis wants to see his daughter, as her face is \"marked\" with a type of leprosy, while her heart is pure. She wants to see his Onion Knight (Davos), but Stannis informs her he's locked in a dungeon for betrayal. She goes to visit Davos in his cell, to provide reading and offering to help him learn to read just to be with him. It never hurts to have a little warmth in a show filled to the brim with dark souls and rotten characters. Selyse hasn't been able to give Stannis a son, jars of fetuses reminding her of her failure. And as we have seen in the past, it is no surprise Stannis desire Melisandre so. Seeing the Brotherhood worshiping the same god as Melisandre is quite a shock, but the god of fire wouldn't be so confined to just a certain area and not spread further north.Roose Bolton offers Jaime help with his wound, better quarters to sleep, and a hotbath to bathe. Jaime doesn't want to lose his whole arm so he will endure a procedure by a doc who was stripped of his maester status due to \"experiments\". It is an interesting turn of events. Roose even tells Jaime that his family was victors at King's Landing. What are Roose's real intentions? Jaime, at his lowest, sits in the bath, unwilling and not desiring a confrontation with Brienne, tells her of why he killed the Mad King. That he couldn't obey the King and kill his father or allow wildfire to bathe the entire kingdom in some great spread burn. It was a decision that has lived in infamy because Jaime chose his father, families and children, over the oath and honor of a Hand of the King. Brienne listened in horror, understanding his sacrifice. This is Nikolaj Coster-Waldau's finest moment in the character because it revealed a vulnerability and weight Jaime had carried. And Christie deserves credit, too, as Brienne's reaction to Jaime's recollection speaks of how awful his situation really was. Best sequence in the episode.Barristan Selmy riding alongside Jorah tries to prepare him for when they do take the kingdom, speaking about the circle, how they were once rivals, and the idea of actually supporting and representing a Queen worth the trouble. I enjoyed their banter, but Jorah's dedication to Daenerys is unquestioned. Selmy wants to know if she is worth fighting for and defending, and Jorah is without a doubt she is. But Selmy trying to judge both Jorah and Daenerys, whether they are prepared for the pressures and difficulties that come with the Iron Throne, does leave us wondering where he truly stands.Jon Snow finally can no longer get away from Ygritte and the sexual tension and desires between them. Once inside a cavern with a hot spring, Jon gives in to his urges with just a wee little bit of seduction from Ygritte. We see as they cuddle, touch, and caress each other, talking about never wanting to leave the cavern, that there has been a bond...not just sweet lovin'. When questioned by Giantsbane and his warg about the Night's Watch's forces, Jon tells them but he's challenged on his loyalty. You see Jon aggressively emphasize his words are true...that he is worth trusting in their cause.Includes is Thoros of Myr (Paul Kaye), mentioned by Selmy to Jorah, telling Arya she would be reunited with her brother soon, The Hound fighting through the fire that is his weakness to vanquish in the swordfight (even though only a few minutes, it is incredibly well orchestrated in a cave, with the sword aflame), Tyrion having to negotiate funds for the wedding with Olenna over financial help (her dismissing him as browbeaten just further humiliates the poor guy), and plenty of God of Fire getting some love in the episode.",

                    "content": "This week showcased another stellar episode of Game of Thrones in which previously dormant issues are most certainly beginning to erupt in a wonderfully foreboding nature and the true price of loyalty begins to surface. Oh and Jon Snow finally has sex. Mazel tov!First off we return to Arya, Gendry and the Brotherhood without Banners who are serving the 'Lord of Light' and putting Hound's innocence to the test in a deciding sword fight against their leader. Much to Arya and the Brotherhood's dismay, Hound actually wins the fight (against a flaming sword and all) and is released. The Brotherhood announce they will reunite Arya with her brother the following morning but Gendry decides to stay and serve as a blacksmith, sick of being loyal to the wrong people. Poor Arya seems to be losing everyone around her and for the first time, bathed in the light of fire, we see a burning sense of despair that she is inevitably feeling.Jon Snow continues to questionably serve the Wildlings, but it is fair to say that his loyalty to the Nights Watch is most definitely over after breaking a sworn oath. That's right, thanks to Ygritte's nudey and luring ways, both succumb to the sexual tension that has plagued their relationship. It's a well executed development and about bloody time too. Stannis Baratheon continues to be almost on par with Joffrey as contender for television's biggest douchebag. He visits his wife with the intention of confessing adultery and impregnating Melisandre. However she is fully aware of the situation, in fact she seems to be on board with it all believing that someone must fulfill such wifely duties of providing a son. Something which she has undoubtedly failed to do, going by the preserved collection of foetuses that prominently decorate her room. She does however have a daughter but keeps her hidden away due to her facial disfigurement. Not a brilliant mother then, and no surprises that Stannis hasn't particularly been the best father either. In fact he has locked away the only man who has, Ser Davos, who remains imprisoned feeling the weighty punishment for straying loyalties.Jaime and Brienne are finally handed over to Lord Bolton who treats them in a slightly more hospitable manner than their captors. They're even allowed to bathe, providing what is at first a comical sequence but transgresses into another cleverly written stepping-stone in their friendship. In a moment of relentless vulnerability, Jaime is laid bare literally and figuratively when revealing the truth over his 'kingslayer' name. A breakdown wonderfully performed by Nikolaj Coaster- Waldau that will no doubt have consequences regarding Brienne's loyalty to Lady Stark.Robb Stark is still dealing with terrible bad luck and un-loyal soldiers as Richard Karstark, in an act of vengeance, murders the two young Lannister hostages. Robb is outraged at this act of betrayal and as a punishment, decides to behead Karstark contrary to the advice from his wife and mother. As feared this move resulted in the rest of the Karstark family leaving Robbs army, placing him in a weaker position than ever. He decides his only chance of re-strengthening his army is to take Casterly Rock which will be made possible by befriending Walder Frey \u2013 the man whose daughter was promised to marry Robb. Oops. Back in Astapor there are no moves of bad-ass proportion from Daenerys this week. Instead Ser Jorah Mormont and Ser Barristan Selmy converse in a battle of worthiness and loyalty to Daenerys. It feels only a matter of time before this mode of civil conversation gets a little more heated. In King's Landing Tyrion meets with Olenna Tyrell, in a highly anticipated union of characters, to discuss the finances of the big royal wedding. It is a brief moment of comical discourse, played brilliantly by Diana Rigg, who out-smarts and out-wits Tyrion, a tough feat by any means. Most shattering, however, is Cersei's reveal (thanks to the help of Littlefinger) that Marjaery Tyrell is planning to marry off Sansa to her gay brother, Loras. In order to prevent this happening and keep Sansa (the heir of Winterfell) in line with the Lannisters, Tywin instructs Tyrion to marry Sansa instead. To the credit of Peter Dinklage, the heart-wrenching devastation exudes from his eyes over the nature of his father's order. Not only will this crush Tyrion and Shae's relationship but there is also a genuine concern for Sansa. Tywin's 'I- hate-my-children' reign does not finish there. He also orders Cersei to marry Loras. She naturally declines of course, but Tywin will not be defied and is adamant that orders will be carried out. Although the proverbial apples do not fall so far from the tree and something tells me it won't be as easy as all that...In addition to the one or two note-worthy performances, the stand-out element for this week was the episode's overwhelming foreboding nature. From horrific rain storms to over-powering shadows that devour half of the shot \u2013 it all alludes to the encroaching and explosive drama that will unfold resultant from the aforementioned character developments. Once again each trope was well balanced, moving at a pace that befitted the narrative. Yet whether its two minutes in Astapor or ten in King's Landing, each moment is continuously captivating.Overall Game of Thrones continues to simmer this week, as tension reaches a new level \u2013 so does the impending sense of doom and devastation. Whilst it does require you to rack your brains for previous plot points, the episode is nevertheless well written by Bryan Cogman, as each character trope is well balanced and distributed. Characters' various loyalties are questioned but with their development of a calibre this high, our loyalty to the show most definitely isn't.",

I hated the way jons and ygrittes scene was done in the book this moment was built up and felt more believable but neither of them have had any real airtime to build chemistry and what was with lady baratheons fetuses that is definitely a change from the books i don't like. Grey Worms speech to Dany was really moving exactly how i imagined it to be. and robb continues to ignore the advice of his mother like that hasn't bitten him in the as before.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Climb\" is heavy in character interaction and exposition, and is not what one would call an action-packed episode. Instead, it is perhaps Season 3 at its most contemplative and intimate. Which is no way a bad thing, 'Game of Thrones' have done these types of episodes several times before and it's always come off brilliantly. \"The Climb\" may start off a touch on the slow side, but for all its intimacy it's a gripping episode where the exposition always serves a point and doesn't bog things down and characterisation is as rich as ever.It is the truly tense scaling of the wall that is particularly memorable here in \"The Climb\". The interaction between Tywin and Olenna is similarly exquisite (especially in their negotiation), as are the honest and emotionally resonant writing for Littlefinger and a visually beautiful and perceptive ending. Arya and Melisandre's scene is beautifully played and written and Theon's treatment here is disturbing.All the acting is superb, with the best performances coming from Charles Dance, Diana Rigg, Maisie Williams and Aidan Gillen.Visually, \"The Climb\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Climb\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Overall, Season 3 delivers again. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The most-remembered part of the episode is, however, Littlefinger and his chilling \"chaos is a ladder\" speech, perhaps his finest moment of the entire show.",

Why is Theon being tortured by that sniveling little jerk and why does he have so much power over life and death. No dragons this time. She's on her way, though, and what will happen when those things reach full size. It's like having deflated footballs. There is this incredible scene as the winter people climb the ice wall and peer over the other side. Tyrion and his sister are now commiserating over who is whose enemy and whether the dwarf was her target. Does it matter. They are all potentially deadly and blood certainly isn't thicker than water, unless ambition can be satisfied. We are off to the races as the next episode unfolds. The wedding is coming and Littlefinger is using his wiles and trying to manipulate his way to the top.",

The climb won't be easy and not everybody will make it. Elsewhere there is more talk of weddings as Lord Frey demands that Robb's uncle Edmure must marry one of his daughters as restitution for Robb breaking his word and Lady Olenna Tyrell is not pleased with Tywin Lannister's plans to have her son marry Queen Cersei rather than Sansa Stark. Theon finally learns the identity of his tormentor but things are only getting worse for him. In the Riverlands Melisandre visits the Brotherhood without Banners and takes Gendry from them leading Arya to confront her.While there isn't a huge amount of action this is a gripping episode. The scaling of the wall was tense as there was the constant feeling that fatal falls could happen at any moment; acrophobics may certainly feel the sense of height as the camera shows the huge drop below the climbers. These scenes are tense but not as disturbing as those involving Theon; his tormentor is one of the least pleasant characters in the series\u0085 although not as bad as Joffrey who we learn has murdered a popular minor character for the sadistic pleasure. This also emphasises just how dangerous Lord Baelish is as he provided the poor girl to punish Lord Varys; the scene between Aidan Gillen and Conleth Hill which led up to this shock was great. While not action packed the scene between Maisie Williams and Carice van Houten, as Arya and Melisandre, was brilliant as it showed Arya's inner strength and Melisandre's response suggests that young Arya is going to become a taker of many lives. Overall a fine episode that hints at things to come.",

Seriously, what an a-hole! Ygritte tells Jon no matter what side he's on, that they're in it together. They climb the wall, some of it breaks away and Jon saves Ygritte. Tywin and Olenna meet to discuss marriages, Tywin should of just killed her instead of listening to that drivel. Arya's the last left of her party as Gendry's taken away. Jaime's going to be released but Brienne won't be. I don't recall Daenerys being in this episode and way too many characters I have little interest in took up screen time.Ygritte: You're loyal. And you're brave. You didn't stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayder's tent. But I'm your woman now, Jon Snow. You're going to be loyal to your woman. The Night's Watch don't care if you live or die. Mance Rayder don't care if I live or die. We're just soldiers in their armies, and there's plenty more to carry on if we go down. But it's you and me that matters to me and you. Don't ever betray me.Ygritte, Jon, Arya and Jaime the standouts.",

Maybe there are some deleted scenes, but I'll see if I could find them.Anyway, everything else turned out great. The performances are still solid, the relationships continue to shine, the music score and scenery are still beautiful and gorgeous, the directing is superb, the story/script is still well-written, and the editing is still sharp. And that's all I have to say, so, this is another solid episode and looking forward to review the last four. :)",

They are talking about the Wall, just before we actually see the Wall and the danger it presents to the Wildlings. The Robb/Frey scene, also another prologue to a much bigger plot, beautifully executed. Perhaps the best ones where Jaime&Brianne/LordBolton, Tyrion/Sansa and Theon/\"Boy\". Wonderful performance by the whole cast! And that Petyr/Varys scene, damn!!! What a friggin' good scene!!! From Joffrey having executed Ros to Sansa weeping over the departure of Petyr's ship, it was all awesome!! And that final scene on top of the Wall between Jon and Ygritte was extremely good! A real romance born there!I must say I am greatly disappointed in Arya's scene....I understand this is an adaptation of the books....but still, why couldn't they just add a small-time actor to play Edric Storm? Why did they had to, once again, alter everything in the books and make to characters who never meet, met? I didn't mind Robb meeting Qyburn, but Arya meeting Melissandre is a whole different thing....I just hope D.B. and David know what they are doing, and that they are keeping in mind both George R. R. Martin as the fans of the books....",

The perfectly titled \"The Climb\" provided much to think about. Contrasting themes of order and chaos, cynicism and optimism. The final 10 minutes provide perhaps one of the most beautifully shot contrasts of worldview ever done. A contrast between a cynical view of life and an optimistic one, Littlefinger's monologue strikes the viewer in its overall harshness and unfortunate plausibility - that mostly people delude themselves in life, spoken over such convincing supporting visuals as only game of thrones can provide. This scene is immediately followed by a final scene which contrasts this viewpoint that is so beautiful and touching that the viewer feels nearly uneasy. In any other show the final scene could have become meaningless sweetness but in game of thrones it resonates, because we realize that true happiness is rare and fleeting, but we hope that it lasts, we hope Littlefinger is wrong, though we realize, especially in the world of Westeros, he is most probably right.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" may be one of the weaker episodes of Season 3, one that has divided critics and fans (more mixed to favourable), and one of my least favourites of the show up to this point. That it is still a very good episode, from personal opinion anyhow, is indicative of how amazing a show 'Game of Thrones' is. It is more of a set-up episode of what is about to come, and is not the most exciting 'Game of Thrones' has been. It's far from dull though and the story made perfect sense to me. It's not action-heavy and focuses more on the characters, their interactions and dialogue, this is not a problem because actually 'Game of Thrones' have proven many times that they do this kind of episode very well, brilliantly for some, just as much as when they do episodes that are heavier in action. Not everything works. The pacing could have been tightened, and this could have been achieved by in particular by shortening Theon's torture sequences which do go on forever. Wouldn't have said no even to them being excised because they didn't add very much and felt very extreme even for torture.Flaws aside, there are scenes that work extremely well. The final scene is particularly wonderful, tense, thrilling and just spectacular and one of the season's better endings. The Daenerys and slaver scene and the Tywin and Joffrey confrontation are just as brilliant.Visually, \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Direction especially shines in the final scene and the Tywin and Joffrey confrontation, while the acting is uniformly superb.Summing up, very good episode but not the best one of the best shows in recent years has to offer. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The climax of this one is particularly good and perhaps one of the most dramatic of the season, while the events surrounding Theon reach their darkest and most sadistic nadir. The best episode has Joffrey being schooled by Tywin, although the romantic interlude between Jon and Ygritte is surprisingly touching.",

Jaime leaves Harrenhal escorted by the Bolton guards but when he learns the fate of Brienne, he forces the men to return to rescue the lady from Locke and an angry bear.In \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\", Jaime has a surprising attitude saving Brienne from her captors. I never believed that he could take such noble attitude. Daenery is impressive and is conquering one city after another. Theon continues to get what he deserves. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\"",

                    "content": "As usual this episode follows multiple intertwined plot strands. Jon Snow and the Wildlings are now south of the wall and heading for Castle Black; we also learn that Orell dislikes Jon because of his jealousy of his relationship with Ygritte as well as general distrust. Also in the north Bran and those with him head towards the wall and he reveals his intention to go north of the wall rather than go to Castle Black. Back in King's Landing Tywin Lannister has a talk with Joffrey that subtly demonstrates what he thinks of his grandson and Tyrion's engagement to Sansa makes things difficult between him and Shae. Elsewhere Arya flees from the Brotherhood and finds herself in the hands of the Hound and Theon's torment appears to be over when a couple of young beauties untie him\u0085 only for things to get much worse when his tormentor returns. Jaime and Brienne are finally separated and he is sent back towards King's Landing; however he persuades is captors to turn back when he learns what is likely to happen to Brienne. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys intends to free the slaves in the city of Yunkai; by force if necessary.As the third series starts to approach its end the tensions are rising nicely; sometimes in obvious ways, such as Arya being grabbed by the Hound and sometimes in more subtle ways, such as how Robb's attendants talking about Lord Frey taking offence if they allow the rains to delay their arrival at his castle. Once again one has to feel sorry for Theon despite his previous behaviour\u0085 although at times the scene felt like an excuse for more nudity. Some may find the episode a bit dialogue heavy but I rather enjoyed it; especially the scenes between Tywin and Joffrey where the former's every word dripped with polite contempt and a lighter scene where Bronn teased Tyrion about his predicament with Sansa and Shae. Those preferring action should enjoy the episodes end where Jaime shows that he intends to protect Brienne even if that means jumping unarmed into a bear pit to rescue her! While there is little action in Daenerys's scene it was fun and hinted at a battle to come. Overall another enjoyable episode.",

Virtually every word uttered by Tywin is dripping with sarcasm and barely veiled contempt. Joffrey is considered by many to be the most evil character in the series, although strong arguments can be made for Cersei, Tywin, Jamie and ultimately Danaerys for that honour. Those who dislike Joffrey should revel in his complete dressing down, which I suggest is the most memorable take from this episode and by far the most prolonged debuking of him in the entire series. Brilliantly performed by Charles Dance, one of my two favorite performers in the series, the other being Stephen Dillane as Stannis.",

WHAT THE HELL HAS HAPPENED? Instead of dramatic arcs, episodes this season as a series of disjointed vignettes that they don\u02bbt even try to weave a dramatic thread between. Instead they spend more time adding unnecessary detail to the extreme BDSM treatment of Theon Greyjoy. I love Iwan Rheon as an actor, but one or two quick scenes are enough to tell us about how Theon will evolve...this is gratuitous and the time would be better spent on laying out the over all narrative. If it weren\u02bbt for the strong source material (thank you George RR Martin), this would be an unwatchable mess of disconnected plot points, under-motivated actions, and, as I pointed out, sex/violence that isn\u02bbt being used to drive the narrative forward. The weak directing was most clearly demonstrated when the Yukai arrives to negotiate - what the hell was the purpose of the long arrival scene? To burn some of the budget and add minutes to fill out a short and empty episode? Hire some writers folks! Hire a new director! This is one of the most epic stories written and you gotta do better than your doing.",

To see Jaimie become from what he was in the start of the series and who he became now and to see all the overwhelming emotions coming in him and what he is going through and why he is how he is and he's not all that bad, he's starting to care for someone. He and Brienne have seen so many things together, their freindship, there love care and respect for each other is there even though it's unsaid and I could feel it. All of it made me very emotional, i was almost crying.I also loved to see how silently and smartly cunning Margery Tyrell is, and is going about her business manipulating people. I can't wait to see when Daenerys Targaryen ,Arya Stark and Jon Snow will come around in Westeros and how that will bring the story forward and how much drama and action it will cause. All in all it was a very emotional and fun episode, the best in game of thrones Yet. And I am positive that I am always going to remember this episode as one of the highlights of this TV show.",

                    "content": "Jon and Ygritte are the highlight of the episode, keep your eyes on them! There's also a piece of history that is revealed from their dialog that adds weight to their mission. I even liked the scene between Robb and Jeyne. The love scenes in this season as a whole are done particularly well actually. This is probably to compensate for dulling our senses with all the gratuitous yet equally unnecessary sex/extreme violence scenes that are all over the place in this show. Unfortunately these are present in this episode as well, but at least they don't go the full way (which I was afraid they would at one point, unsurprisingly involving Theon).The evolution of Brienne and Jaime are a delight to watch... at least they were in the beginning, but by the end of it I felt some writers forgot about these characters entirely and had to come up with lines for them just before the actors went on cameras. There is also a near escape sequence that was done particularly poorly, bearing witness to the show's budget constraints and human retardation. 'How could a man with only 1 hand climb that?' - I found myself asking. 'Damn with the limitations of human nature and physics!' - said every Hollywood director that ever lived, ever!!Bronn's character - damn, that guy likes reminding us that he's a good actor. The banter between him and Tyrion is fun, as usual, while the little man has some tough decisions ahead of him, judging from what they set up for him this far. Let's hope those end up being executed well.Sansa is still hanging around with Margaery; I guess some things never change. Bran, Hodor, the Reed brothers and that wild-ling lady (I always forget her name) are still heading North, but suffice to say is they're probably not going to meet any familiar faces anytime soon. Arya is still mad on the Brotherhood. Melisandre is still weird as... the night sky would be with two moons? No complaints there. Sam and his new friend with the baby are completely absent in this episode bo-hoo.Daenarys is fierce as ever and those dragon, ho-boy. They know how to portray their dragons in this show! She's kind of reached a halt, at this grand-city called Yunkai, that was build on the back of many, many slaves and well... she's a bit unhappy about that. I'm curious to see just how much she gets held back by this new challenge :DSadly there was no scene featuring Cersei, either. So where do we get our dose of barely contained rage, by a thin shell of cynicism you wonder? Look no further than Tywin's scene with Joffrey. It's always nice to see two badass blondes - each in their own way - duke it out for the best.So, what is my final take on this episode: sub-par. I was left at the end with a taste of bitter bile in my mouth and that wasn't due to the coffee I had while watching it. You see, even though I praised individual scenes, the sum of its parts is not greater than the whole, surprisingly. The motivation behind the characters seem a bit shallow, probably because they are so many at this point and so far apart from each other... It's like all the major characters' strengths rely on one- another, but as soon as they have an individual scene to perform, they act bewildered. And you know which are the main characters of the show I'm talking about: they are all the surviving ones, from the 1st season with few additions. Also, it's like they are not given enough care from the directors and the producers involved, like their personal journey and evolution does not matter, unless it involves another sex/extreme violence scene. Well, I CARE about these characters' evolution arcs and I WANT to see them being well-portrayed damit!The set-pieces are great - GoT crew! - and the amount of detail are charming to the eye, but... look, if this show wasn't sourcing Martin's masterpiece material, I would not be watching this. The 1st season was great and I can find absolutely no criticism: it was raw and powerful. With the 2nd and 3rd season, I feel like I am forced to watch the limitations of the productions's team, botching big action scenes and generally showcasing an unfocused view of their product. If you want to sell this to me AGAIN then you will have to figure out a direction for the story and not just do stuff 'because George Martin said so'. Books don't work the same as stories meant for the screens. Where's your sense of independence that season 1 thrived on and drove the show to success?*Sigh* I miss the good old days... does that make me old?",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Second Sons\" is not my favourite episode of Season 3, that belongs to \"And Now His Watch is Ended\" (though it is one of the better ones), but it is a step up from the previous episode \"The Bear and the Maiden Fair\" (very good still, but not great). It sets up the following episodes very well with a huge amount to recommend. Some meandering pacing is the sole drawback from personal opinion to a great episode that is a long way from second rate. The scenes between Tyrion and Sansa, both humorous and intense, and Ser Davos and Stannis are particularly strong in the character interaction, but the highlight of the episode is the electrifying ending, one of the season's best bar none. The acting is uniformly very strong, outstanding in the case of especially Peter Dinklage.Visually, \"Second Sons\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Second Sons\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.In summation, great episode. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Tyrion gets married with Sansa and gets drunk in the feast. Then he tells to Sansa in their room that he will sleep in a separate bed, and will only consume the marriage if she wants.\"Second Sons\" is another great episode of Game of Thrones. Daenerys is an amazing character, conquering her royalty with her attitudes. The dragonglass dagger that Sam has found is incredibly powerful and he might be the first human that has killed a White Walker. Will the black magic with the three leeches be well suceeded? Tyrion is another great character of this amazing series. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Second Sons\"",

However Tyrion's father is determined that not only are they wed but Sansa is to provide him with a grandchild quickly. During the wedding Tyrion gets rather drunk and threatens Joffrey then afterwards he ignores his father and lets Sansa sleep alone. The other important development is the fact that the Yunkai have hired a mercenary army, known as the Second Sons, to protect them from Daenerys army of Unsullied; she believes that an army that fights for money might be persuaded to switch sides. Elsewhere we learn that The Hound is planning to take Arya to her family rather than back to King's Landing, Stannis releases Lord Davos while Melisandre is with Gendry and finally Sam must fight one of the White Walkers.This was an enjoyable episode; this is largely due to Peter Dinklage's performance as Tyrion Lannister; he did a great job showing Tyrion getting drunker and drunker which led up to him threatening the odious King Joffrey\u0085 a most satisfying moment. Jack Gleeson does well as Joffrey; managing to make the character genuinely vile rather than a mere pantomime villain. The scenes outside the city of Yunkai were enjoyable as we wait to see what will happen between Daenerys and the Second Sons; she certainly doesn't seem concerned by their leader's unpleasant threats. While the other scenes weren't as important within the episode they hint at things to come; what will come from Melisandre's use of Gendry's blood and will Sam's discovery concerning the dragon glass prove useful in the upcoming conflict with the White Walkers? Overall this was an impressive episode.",

Sam and Gilly encounter a White Walker, in which Sam kills with dragon glass. Bit too easy for me, Sam shouldn't be able to kill anything, ever.Tyrion, Sansa, Tywin and Joffrey the standouts.",

Having so many flaws that make it just plain stupid to view. Although if I am an adolescent teenager I might get roused enough to give some praise, even then this episode would still be questionable.Davos Seaworth is released from Dragonstone Keep's dungeons. All so's he could learn hows to wead. Showing Stannis Baratheon as little more then a pretender, who is about as fickle as his will. What was the point in putting Davos in the dungeon, if he is going to be released without any consequence. Forgive and forget,here have a slap on the wrist. He ate as good as he would have normally this was mentioned. His sons are dead in the Battle of the Blackwater, except possibly those with his wife who aren't on Dragonstone. Well what a result he can now do his A,B,C's.Daario is a super ninja. How amazing that he gets past all Daenery's Unsullied, Bloodriders and Knights. So he could give head, or get ahead? Yes we are all envious, thank you for the peek.Deanery's doesn't seem to mind vulgarity about her assets. Slavers are very bad though they get dragon fire, however her slit is open for debate, so long as she gets some... allegiance.I find despite those above questions. I am in utter complaint at this episode in it's showing of a Whitewalker. I them to be unforgivable and deplorable. Whitewalkers are shown as little more then mindless zombies reminiscent of a very bad zombie horror film. Brains, Brains, Brains or was it Baby, Baby, Baby. Samwell the Craven Tarly, has no trouble defeating the hermit pedo with it's one track mind, or rather a zombie. Making any other Whitewalker seem absolutely harmless. I am bewildered, wondering if they are so harmless. Why was a 600ft high Icewall was constructed to keep them away? People have mentioned saying Winter is Coming, The Night is Dark and Full Of Terrors. Don't worry lads your average mindless craven can kill one, they will just explode. The CGI was so dreadful masked entirely in FX's, watch the pretty snowflakes go Poof, while missing every aspect of that terrible nightmare. That Whitewalker had no fighting style, no weapon, no magic, no intelligence. We are now as viewers super scared quaking at that Ice from a song of Fire. We have seen the dragons and watched R'hllor make baby shadows, then resurrects the mortally wounded. Well, Icewalkers show there ass to cravens so they can get ripped a new one to get shattered. Honestly I am wondering, if it got the baby would it have left Sam and Gilly alone? Because it didn't seem interested in the sword wielder. One can only assume yes, it would have just walked away using it's mighty zombie intelligence. Paranorman had better CGI and was funnier.This episode aside had some moments with witty dialogue and acting. In expectancy from this award winning show. Cersi - Margaery dialogue. I love those historic exchanges in regards to the lore of Game of Thrones and showing how brutal these characters are in entirety.3 out of 10. The worst episode in this series, somebody needs a clobbering if that was the best they could do.",

Also nice to see this chill looking guy killed his lousy comrades and declare his army to Daenerys, who is becoming obnoxiously powerful. Also nice to see Tyrion stand up to his idiot superiors/family members and play by his own rules.Sam gets some action!And on top of that he kills (defeats?

                    "content": "The writing for this show is of exceptional quality on a weekly basis. However, the writing for Second Sons was on a whole new level, showing that Benioff and Weiss know how to write fantastic scripts. The quality of the script is largely the result of the sensible idea to focus on three main plot lines this week, rather than the usual broad focus of the show (which is by no means bad).The episode started with Arya poised to bash a big rock over the Hound's skull, only for her to realise that she probably couldn't kill him if she tried. This led to a brilliant scene of dialogue in which the Hound spoke of men worse than him who Arya could've ended up with, revealing the Hound to be another of the grey characters that inhabit a universe where there is no true good or evil (except for Joffrey).Tyrion and Sansa's wedding in Kings Landing was the perfect mix of awkwardness and humour. Two death threats were issued in which, Cersei threatened to strangle her \"sister\" Margaery in her sleep (before owning Loras) and Tyrion threatened to chop Joffrey's cock off. Joffrey certainly deserved this for his antics in this episode alone, as he removed the stall Tyrion needed to cloak his bride and threatened to rape Sansa once Tyrion had passed out. Finally, Tyrion spent a large portion of the ceremony drunk, leading to an awkward scene with Tywin in which Tywin advised his son that he was too drunk to seal the marriage sexually. Dinklage played this to perfection, with Tyrion promising never to force himself upon Ssnsa, leading to the memorable line \"And now my watch begins\", when Sansa ruled sex out.At Dragonstone Melisandre brought Gendry before Stannis, prompting an interesting conversation about the secret sacrificial of lambs, as Gendry was unknowingly about to become part of a ritual. It was Gendry's proposed sacrifice, that motivated Stannis to free Davos (who's up to toddler level reading). This resulted in a brilliantly written scene in which Davos correctly assumes that Stannis freed him at that precise moment, because he knew that Davos would counsel restraint in regards to Gendry. After a brief discussion about wealth, Melisandre began to have sex with Gendry, who incorrectly assumed that some kinky stuff was going on when she tied him up. Of course, her plan was to tie him up and to leech him (one was on his penis), in order to demonstrate her power to Davos, with Stannis casting them into the fire (reciting the names of the 3 usurper kings). The moral of the story here was don't accept sex with a random stranger in Westeros, as it signals bad times for your penis (Gendry this week and Theon last week).Outside of Yunkai, Daenerys had an audience with the three mercenary captains of the Second Sons, elaborating on how they couldn't possibly defeat her army. This prompted a great line from Jorah when he said \"The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run\" and a pleasing promise from Barristan to kill the crass Mero in battle. The Second Sons then had a perfectly valid debate about the differences between whores and mercenaries, before the camp Daario was chosen to kill Daenerys. This led to the one flawed scene of the episode for me, when Daario crept into Daenrys' camp with the heads of the other two captains, swearing his allegiance to her. As a reader of the books I know that what happened was accurate. However, I would've liked to have seen the show change it so that either Barristan or Jorah killed the captains and I also, took issue with Daario pledging his heart to Dany after just meeting her.Finally, the episode ended with Sam killing a White Walker in epic fashion. However, before that we had two great moments of dialogue between him and Gilly, where Sam recalled childhood traumas whilst trying to come up with baby names and the difference between a wink and a blink was debated. This culminated in a fantastic action sequence, with the White Walker coming to steal Gilly's baby, before Sam rescued her. The CGI and effects for this sequence were fantastic, once again pushing the boundaries of what TV is capable of.Best Quotes: Tyrion: \"I'm the God of tits and wine\" Mero-Jorah: \"The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won\" \"The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run\" Olenna Tyrell: Messed up family tree bit.",

Also surprising is that Gendry takes over the role of Eldric completely, I just wonder whether Davros now will be freed and how this story will develop in the series.

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Rains of Castamere\" deserves its reputation as one of the best episodes of 'Game of Thrones'. It is the magnum opus of Season 3 and is one of the magnum opuses of the whole show along with the likes of \"Baelor\" and \"Blackwater\". Said recently that \"And Now His Watch is Ended\" was the best episode of Season 3. Have to take this back, \"The Rains of Castamere\" has dethroned it. It is the ending that is widely lauded and for very good reason. It is impossible to forget and one has to check as whether it's an ending of a television episode when it puts so many film endings in recent years to shame. The ending here is truly powerful in the best of ways, shocking, tense and emotionally devastating. That is not to say that the rest of the episode is no less impressive, everything else is done phenomenally but the ending is out of this world. While all the acting is superb across the board, it is Michelle Fairley's tour-De-force of a performance that dominates. That she wasn't even nominated for a Emmy, when she was as good and perhaps even better than all the supporting actress nominees in the category, makes for one of the greatest injustices in Primetime Emmy history.Visually, \"The Rains of Castamere\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Rains of Castamere\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Altogether, amazing magnum opus. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Seeing it now, repeated after all these years, and it still holds up as one of the most unflinching and brutal episodes of television history. The last 20 minutes or so are sheer perfection when it comes to drama, but there's no ignoring the earlier events either, packed with action, incident and growing tension as they are. A masterclass in production and a true high point of the show's history, this is what GAME OF THRONES is all about.",

I have not read the Martin opus and so as I make my way through these video episodes, I become attached to certain characters. I have come to accept the fact that no one is exempt from violence. That the producers of this show are not going to contrive a set of events that are totally predictable and wrap things up in a bundle. This is anything but. What is left right now is a question as to what will happen next. Some of the more intriguing possibilities have been squelched by blood and arrogance. Two themes that are continually in our faces are the themes of power versus justice. When all these factions end up at war with the purpose of achieving an equilibrium, we must always be aware that human foibles are much more likely to screw things up. Hurt feelings can lead to devastating results. Insult is followed by injury. The final scenes of this episode are utterly gut wrenching and so sad. I find now that I must ask myself, Who it is I'm supposed to care about? What an upheaval!",

Jon Snow is requested to kill and old man to prove his loyalty to the wildlings but Ygritte kills the man instead. Bran and his friends are hidden in a nearby mill and Bran uses his power of entering in the mind of two direwolves to help Jon to escape. At the Twins, Edmure marries Roslin Frey, who is a beautiful woman. During the feast, Catelyn, Robb and their Northern friends find that they have been betrayed by Walder Frey and they are slaughtered by his guards. Arya and the Hound have just arrived in time to see the murder of Robb's guard. \"The Rains of Castamere\" is the most surprising episode of \"Game of Thrones\". The betrayal of Robb, Catelyn and their friends from the North was absolutely unexpected and the Melisandre's black magic seems to be working and the first name that Stannis said is gone. Jon Snow leaves Ygritte behind and I believe his act will bring consequences. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"The Rains of Castamere\"",

                    "content": "The main part of the story in this episode is the marriage of Edmure Tully to one of the granddaughters of Walder Frey. It starts a little uncomfortably as Robb apologises for breaking his vow to marry one of Walder's daughters but things get better; Edmure is certainly not disappointed by his bride and as the celebration progresses everything seems happy\u0085 right up until the moment it becomes obvious that Walder Frey doesn't except Robb's apology and intends to have his very bloody revenge! While all this is going on we also see Arya and Sandor Clegane getting closer to the site of the Wedding where Arya looks forward to being reunited with her family. Elsewhere Daenerys's forces move against the city of Yunkai and Bran and his fellow travellers take shelter in a mill and are almost found by the group of Wildlings that includes his brother Jon Snow.This is a series that hasn't been scared of killing off major characters but I didn't expect the cull we get at the infamous 'Red Wedding'. Not having read the book and having avoided spoilers this was a real shock when I first watched the episode. The other events are inevitably overshadowed but are still enjoyable; most notable the events at the mill where Bran shows that his skills as a worg a far more powerful than suspected and we learn whether Jon has truly switched sides or if he is still a member of the Night's Watch as Orell suspects. The battle of Yunkai is less action packed then one might expect, no doubt the budget had been spent elsewhere! It still features a decent fight though and the way it is told means we don't learn the outcome before Daenerys, who was waiting in her camp. To use a clich\u00e9 the episode is a roller-coaster of emotions although unlike a roller-coaster it comes crashing down at the end not near the start. The shock of what happened to the Stark's is emphasised by Arya's arrival and her realisation that something is terribly wrong. The cast did a fine job; most notably Michelle Fairley as Catelyn Stark when she begs for her son's life and David Bradley as the vengeful Walder Frey. Overall a brilliant episode that was shocking without being gratuitous.",

I personally had a feeling this was coming but I wasn't entirely sure how, which makes this all the more shocking and sad.The way it's handled you can say is suspenseful from the get go as we see the Starks desperately trying to make some sort of an alliance with the Frays. And we see things go rather well as a relative of the Starks gets married off to one of the daughters, whom turns out to be the better looking one of the lot truth be told. There is just this happy atmosphere, we even get some news that Robb Stark's wife is going to have a child, which meant the Starks will still have a legacy.But as an old saying goes \"It's too good to be true.\" and sure enough it is. I immediately had an unsettling feeling the kind where I know a gunshot is about to go off, as soon as those big doors closed and the band suddenly changed it's tune. I then thought to each of the Starks \"Get the Hell out of there!\" But it's of coruse too late and the results well I'll just say are bloody. It was really heart sinking as we just see both Robb and his mother hold on to the last minutes of their lives. The mom tries to bargain for her son to live; but it was futility at best. Just seeing the look on Robbs face as he sees both his wife and child dead and then standing up and looking at his mom; it was devastation and sadness but also one knowing that both are already dead as both she and he have lost everything that matters in their lives so will they lose there life.This is all the more devastating to House Stark as they have not just lost their kingdom but now most of their family. The Starks were to me honorable protagonists but sadly their are so few which made me worried about their lives more as they are now more vulnerable than ever. I'm also hoping that one or better yet all three will some how triumph somehow and someday.It was a ceremony of tragedy that took place, for the Starks that have lost their lives you will be missed but as another sound of a howling wolf cries out, you will never be forgotten.Rating: 4 stars",

                    "content": "This episode represents the exact center of A Song of Ice and Fire. Several important arcs converge here, one horrible event occurs, and portions of the Starck family almost also converge. Arya is beginning her long trek with Sandor Clegane, maybe even realizing that he is not really her enemy.Two Weddings are occurring almost at once, Sansa and Tyrion, Edmure Tully and Roslin Frey. Edmure isn't even sure which Frey daughter he will wed, they keep it secret until the last minute. In King's landing, Cersei's detestation of Margery becomes blatant. But the events at Frey's Castle all appear friendly and on the Up and Up. Until we remember Jamie's last words to Roose Bolton, about giving his \"regards for Edmure's Wedding\"Jon is pressed to the limit of what he can endure with Tormund and Ygritte, and we have two people in this episode who can \"Warg\" - Orell (Mackenzie Crook) and Brann. But this is the first time it is revealed that Bran can do much more than the average Warg can do- He can enter into a Human Being. And Brann's arc almost intersects with Jon's - As does Arya's and Robb's and Catelyn's - And Arya doesn't realize exactly how lucky she was to be with The Hound.Daenerys already has two full armies: Her loyal Dothraki (what few are left at this point) and the Unsullied. But this episode marks where she picks up the full support of The Second Sons.Meanwhile, on Dragonstone, we start seeing more details of that structure, especially the Dungeon where Stannis is keeping Lord Davos. But Stannis had once again used Dark Magic to call forth the deaths of specific people. And we know that when Melisandre uses blood in her spells, the heinous things she calls forth always happen to the last detail. But due to Davos' counsel, The Red Woman only uses a small portion of Gendry's blood, sapped by Leeches, rather than all of his blood.But the most important arc is the Samwell/Gilly arc - We know that White Walkers were taking Craster's male babies in an agreement to leave him alone so that they can turn said babies into new White Walkers- We saw The Night King doing just this when we met him- But Sam had also picked up the Dragonglass, not knowing it's special significance.And he was fortunate that he had it on him when the White Walker came. This White Walker was different: He was accompanied by a flock of Ravens. We have seen this White Walker before, this is \"No Shirt\", who Sam encountered before. We finally get to see why that Cache of Junk left by the First Men that Sam found was very important.Everything changes from this moment on - And Robb's fate is tied in with Joffrey and Bailon Greyjoy, three people who were marked by The Red Woman using Gendry Baratheon's blood. We didn't know at the time why Stannis chose those three particular people, it soon becomes clear.This episode marks a drastic change in the style of the writing, as all of the elements of the end of the story are now all in place. After this, Bran's abilities are used to exposit very important details about past/present and future. We will start seeing this in \"The Lion and The Rose\"",

This episode is the reason the series exists; the show-runners David Benioff and D.B. Weiss pitched Game of Thrones to HBO with THIS story right here.HBO loves making their serialized dramas have a true sense of believability to them, and Game of Thrones gave us this fateful chapter in George RR Martin's ambitious story. The Rains of Castamere is not just the name of the episode, but the name of a song that's been played throughout the series and is about this: the treachery of The Lannisters: 'in a coat of gold or a coat of red, a lion still has claws'. And of course in this case, The Lannisters persuade Lord Walder Frey, hosting Robb (The King in the North) under his roof, to kill The Starks: an event to be known as 'The Red Wedding'.The Rains of Castamere is an upsetting tragedy and for some viewers it put them right off the series for good; but there's still a massive story after this episode's finished and that's the beauty of HBO television shows: they're cinematic sagas getting the best stories squeezed out of them.As a chapter in the Game of Thrones saga, The Rains of Castamere is THE turning point in the show and it has just about everything that makes the show haunting and memorable.",

                    "content": "I'll try to be as objective as I can. Please do not take this review personally. It's just an opinion. Here it is:The Bad: I start with the bad because I like to be more critic than most of the fanboys who posted reviews here were. Everything seems Hollywoodized. Here's why: Everything in this episode prepares the seeming unthinkable episode finale. So the best part happens at the end(except for Jon's battle which is in middle, but that is not the best part). It's just predictable at some point, especially if you've seen the last two season and that tradition of having everything that's better at the end of episode 9. So let me give you an example from movie masterpieces: The Dark Knight has it's best scenes in the middle(car chase and interrogation, yet alone the bank robbery at the beginning) and that makes for a more surprising film-making which after all, is all that this show is about right? Another example: The Shawshank Redemption has it's best scenes where? Right. Not at the end. The end is just an explanation of how that happened. Take the rooftop scare scene after which Andy gets beer for his colleagues. Then the most surprising twist of the movie: that kid's murder is in the middle of the movie. That is clever and unpredictable film-making at it's finest. And those movies actually makes you care for the characters involved, which makes their death or departure a lot more moving and rememberable, while here Robb is just a guy from the presumably \"good family\" in GOT(although the line between them is very thin and unconvincing for me, doesn't necessarily has to be for you), who makes some stupid decisions during the course of the first three seasons(wandering with his troops instead of attacking and avenging his father's death with intellect not stupidity, cause anyone can go on rampaging on attack but few actually have intellect, he does but doesn't do much with it), and then we're supposed to care for his death? Or for his wife's death which only spend her time f*cking him and not worrying about the danger that surrounds them. These are just a few aspects which I wanted to be more critical about. Now the good parts: The execution... WOW, extraordinary is not enough. From the way the hints of Frey's treason are presented to the ultimate killing scenes, everything seems authentic, believable and stunning. Now the twist at the end is perfectly executed and the way Frey was so polite and opened might have hinted treason but we as viewers just ignored because of the brilliant acting that is in this episode. The screenplay is excellent and the way this episode was build makes for the seeming boredom the season as a full gave impression. Apart from that, I have nothing else to say. Of course this is a subjective opinion(don't let yourself be distracted by the difference in words between my two main paragraphs, in the first one I gave many examples), although I tried as hard as I could to make an objective one. I hope some of you agree with me(obviously not everyone will agree because we are all different, that's why there's never an episode that would be liked by everyone who's seen it), if you don't, please don't take this personally. I just wanted to point a few things out. Cheers!",

The Shocking death of Robb Stark and the destruction of House Stark was brutal but at the same time changed the show forever. This was shocking because of the implications this had on the nation of Westeros. The War of the Five Kings was only really being fought between the Starks and Lannisters at this point, with a few other factions remaining in hiding to plot, such as Stannis Baratheon. This episode fully encapsulates a lack of hope by literally killing our main hero in this war in front of us.",

                    "content": "Warning! Major Plot Spoilers Ahead!I know that this episode stunned the viewing audience during the final fifteen minutes. Perhaps the blow of seeing evil triumph over good in such an abrupt and high-handed fashion was too much for many viewers to take in. I thought the move was a bit too abrupt for the viewers to accept in fifteen minutes--after having invested eighteen hours and two seasons with the characters--but it was nonetheless appropriate and fit in nicely with the cynical themes about justice and morality that George R.R. Martin had developed for his epic fantasy series. I thought the violence of the \"Red Wedding\" was grotesque and shocking as well, but also very well choreographed and composed to elicit maximum pathos from the audience. It is to the credit of the show's creators that they had developed the personalities and motivations of the members of the Stark family---in particular, that of the \"King in the North\" and his mother---enough that most members of the audience would feel anguish at seeing the apparently-righteous North destroyed in one fell swoop. Keep in mind, though, that the Starks are not pure saints---just as the Lannisters are not pure devils. The shades of gray prevalent in the \"Game of Thrones\" universe keeps the plot from being a simple story of \"good guys vs. bad guys.\" In other words, the Starks are not mere \"white hats,\" nor the Lannisters \"black hats:\" they are politicians who have selfish ends for their actions, even if some (like the Starks) behave more righteously than others (Lannisters and Freys) I suppose one of the themes of the \"Rains of Castamere\" is that all's fair in war, including treachery and double-cross. The darkest theme of all is that \"the universe is impartial with regards to morality: evil can certainly triumph over good time and again, and the \"gods\" will do nothing to stop the evil men do.\" The grey universe of \"Game of Thrones\" has never been more clear than in the infamous \"Red Wedding\" episode.The moral ambiguity continues in the parallel story lines of Arya Stark and Jon Snow. Both must make choices with regards to the lives of innocents: should they commit murder to save their own skins, or do they let them live and pay the consequences of their mercy? I thought one of the major themes of the first season was that \"sometimes the ends justify the means,\" which can include killing your enemies. This notion, of course, is vile to the honorable and (mostly) noble-hearted Starks. I thought Arya and Jon's revulsion towards murder was a bit heavy-handed, but they nonetheless emphasized the moral and ethical values of the Stark family---and perhaps why the audience sympathized with them throughout the course of the series. The episode was well done, and the \"Red Wedding\" sequence will go down in television history as one of the most violent and moving moments of a series. The tragedy of the Stark family was moving enough to make this a memorable episode of a masterful show. I can't wait to see how the aftermath of the Red Wedding plays out in Season 4.",

He conquered her castle and she tends his wounds and so the love started, but this was omitted from the movie, as well as the aunt of the princess who pulled her strings as she was working for Lannisters. This was all Tywin's master plan to put a damsel in distress near the young, horny and inexperienced king and make him lose his alliance with the Frey. Robb's wife didn't come to the wedding she escapes in the book. Bolton wasn't at the wedding too. Lady Stark cuts the throat of an nephew not the wife of Walder Frey. Robb's head is replaced by his wolf head, and the naked body of lady Stark is thrown in the river. So for me was a sort of meh this episode. Yea the book is way more gory and detailed, sometimes I hate myself for reading it before watching the whole movie. But as many of you know, the book isn't complete yet, so I'm still curious how is ending. My humble opinion is that Tyrion Lannister is the central figure of the story since he fail to die at least 6 times, which is so odd in G. of T. :)",

It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Mhysa\" may not be the most powerful, grand or barn-storming of season finales and it does pale in comparison to the previous episode \"The Rains of Castamere\" (which in all honesty was on a completely different level, being the magnum opus of a generally fine season of one of the magnum opuses of the whole of 'Game of Thrones'). It may not be the most plot-development-heavy (in terms of the episode itself) or twisty episodes. It also ends on an admittedly uplifting and hopeful but also rather anti-climactic note, that isn't the going out with the bang one expects (Daenerys had a much better final scene in \"And Now His Watch is Ended\"). What \"Mhysa\" does do brilliantly is set things up for Season 4 and propel the action forward, making one highly anticipating the next season rather impatiently. It also excels just as well in past characters, that didn't get the focus they should have before, making welcome and well overdue returns after long absences. \"Myhsa\" was quite a poignant reunion episode of sorts and the softer and character-focused approach, while still having plenty of tension and resonance, to the storytelling was appreciated. Acting is superb all round, it is hard to follow on from Michelle Fairley's tour-De-force performance in \"The Rains of Castamere\" but everybody with no exceptions are more than up to the task, and on the dramatic front only the final scene didn't quite work for me. Direction is fine.Visually, \"Mhysa\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Mhysa\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Overall, a very well executed season finale but it is hard not to feel that there could have been even more than what was given. Everything is done brilliantly, the episode just could have gone a little bit further. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The only mistep is the big climax involving Daenerys, which feels a little perfunctory and overblown to me, especially when compared to the masterful climax of season two. Still, elsewhere it's all excellent, from Bran and Sam's chat to Arya and the Hound embarking on their violent mini-career. Charles Dance shows his mettle once more, and the romance between Jon and Ygritte come to a crashing climax. This season really has been a highlight of the show's entire run.",

This is hard to watch. For all his failings, this unending torture is a bit over the top. Sending his male parts to his father is about as vicious as anything imaginable. Tyrion continues to bate Joffrey and is taking some mighty chances, banking on his father needing him to complete his task. During all this we must ask ourselves if uniting these forces is even within the real of possibility. Danys is out there accumulating bodies to fight for her. She has become a liberator and is now the darling of the masses she is freeing. She has never lifted a finger to fight and yet has the charisma and power to make things happen. There is also that conflict that love puts in the way that is unresolved. Theon's sister has made a vow to bring him home, even though his father won't do a thing. She is going to recruit fifty of the most ruthless killers and head off to free him and her resolve has been very impressive. We also have the sorceress who worships the fire gods actually accepting expediency over personal gratification (who knows, maybe she has had this all along). Then there are are the wanderers. The Stark boys. John Snow. Shot full of arrows and reuniting with Sam. And what about Jaime. He finally appears in the chamber of his sister/lover. He is missing a hand and looks beaten. What is going to happen to him? Great writing, setting up more and more possibilities. Before seeing this and looking at Episode Nine, I thought that the future was so stacked, but there are limitless possibilities. Very nice wrap to the third season.",

                    "content": "I'm not sure if it hit me before but it is this third season where I really appreciated what the writers of this show have managed to achieve. I have never read the books but even from the show I can see lots of characters, lots of families, lots of connections and a lot of \"main\" characters to keep track of. Within the space of a book it must still be a challenge to convey them all and make them live, but within a 10 hour television show it must be even more challenging. It is not just a matter of keeping all the plates spinning, but it is doing it in a way that develops the characters and the stories while drawing the viewer in. It is to the credit of the writers that this show continues to do that.I was surprised by how well they did it here as well because more than before there seemed to be a lot going on. I realized it at first when I considered how little screen time many of the main characters had within this particular 10 hour season. Frequently the characters get minutes to move their part of the story forward, although equally frequently they get longer. The writers have done a great job of knowing when to stay with a character and allow for a softer moment and when to allow a shorter time with a sharper edge and more of a narrative focus. It does it very well because the shorter scenes often have great impact even if it is just a dialogue scene and there is hardly a wasted minute in the whole season. Of course the source material is to be credited because overall the story is engaging but, surprisingly, incredibly accessible. The show has more and more magic to it in this season but it remains about the people, the families, the betrayals and it is all deliciously done. I had recorded the season as it screened and only once it was finished did I start watching \u2013 it was difficult not to wolf it down and indeed I had watched it within a week. Each story is satisfyingly laid out and of course the various twists range from small maneuvers of characters through to gut-wrenching awful developments \u2013 the likes of which are best not spoilt and I was fortunate to have only heard the \"title\" of the main twist, not the detail.The cast do a great job. As I said many of them have very little time but they do make for interesting characters. Some of them have to overplay a little bit but they still work. Everyone has their favorites of course but for me I love Williams, Dinklage, Clarke, Glen and of course the ever-slappable Gleeson. These names jump to my mind but to be honest there aren't any weak links here \u2013 everyone makes the most of the good material to deliver when they have their few minutes on screen.Another great season then thanks to how well it tells a complex but yet accessible story. Hardly a minute is wasted and the show knows when to be blunt and when to take a moment to let characters breathe. The pacing is great and it constantly leaves you wanting to know where it is going. There are many more stories in this show and the only downside of it is that it will be another year before it returns.",

                    "content": "After the events of the previous episode one may be forgiven for thinking the slaughter at The Twins was over but as this episode starts we see Robb's forces are being massacred as his body is paraded with the head of his direwolf sewn on in place of his own. Sandor Clegane rescues Arya from the scene and later must come to her aid again when she slips from his horse and kills a man who she hears boasting about taking part in what happened to her family. On the wall Bran and his party arrive at an unmanned fort; here they meet Sam and Gilly as they head south; Sam warns Bran about the White Walkers but Bran insists that he must head north to find the three-eyed raven. Nearby Ygritte catches up with Jon Snow and three arrows prove that she can't forgive his actions. Seriously wounded he makes it back to Castle Black where he is reunited with his friend Sam. As news of the White Walkers becomes known it becomes apparent that they are the real threat to all the people of Westeros not the Wildlings. Back in King's Landing Tyrion once again clashes with Joffrey and it quickly becomes apparent that Tywin hold Joffrey in contempt as he suggests the petulant king should go to bed. Elsewhere Balon Greyjoy learns what happened to Theon but proposes nothing; his sister meanwhile vows to take the Iron Islands' best killers to help him; Davos Seaworth frees Gendry, mush to the annoyance of King Stannis and Daenerys meets the freed slaves of Yunkai.Inevitably this isn't as shocking as the previous episode but there is still a decent amount of action; it was certainly satisfying to see Arya Stark getting bloody as she kills one of those responsible for the death of her family at The Twins; Maisie Williams does a great job in the role as she makes us believe this young girl has what it takes to kill a man. The scenes in the Small Council chamber were equally good; Peter Dinklage's performance as Tyrion as he confronts his nephew was top notch; Charles Dance and Jack Gleeson were also on top form as Tyrion and Joffrey. The scenes elsewhere nicely hint at what is to come; Bran's story about the man who killed somebody under his protection clearly implies that there will be consequences for Walder Frey. While we don't see any White Walkers everything suggests that it won't be long before the people south of the wall will be in danger soon. The finale outside the walls of Yunkai was pretty stirring as we see the reaction of the freed slaves and they carry Daenerys as her dragons circle overhead. Overall a great conclusion to the season that left me keen to see what happens next.",

In short, I loved it, and I'd give it a 10 out of 10. I don't know why I've felt so reluctant to do that ... maybe because I used to view it as too mainstream, given its zealous and seemingly universal fandom? This would be a dishonest review if I didn't admit that I was hooked on the show I used to make fun of.It has some of the best acting and dialogue in recent memory. The show might be worth watching for Peter Dinklage and Charles Dance's verbal sparring, alone, for example. Now, in this third season, Jon Snow and Daenerys finally evolved into heroes that I could actually root for. (They seemed a bit thinly rendered up until now.) I actually cheered when she wiggled that deal to purchase \"The Unsullied\" slave army. And there was just more ... fun stuff -- dragons, White Walkers, melees, surprise attacks, etc.At times the show feels slow to me -- its is still pretty chatty, and neither the White Walkers nor Daenerys' forces will ever win a war by moving swiftly. After three years of the show, they're ... still moving south and north, respectively. Rommel would have routed them easily.And, at times, \"Game of Thrones\" is too dark even for me. The scenes of torture and the bloody betrayals among allies' sometimes make me think that the writers (or George R. R. Martin himself) simply wish to depress their audience.Those things can't prevent me from being just as hooked on this as everyone else, though. Great stuff.",

If you've seen Red Wedding and haven't seen Mhysa yet do yourself a favor and just skip it to avoid the let down as you'll gain absolutely no new information, story lines aren't advanced in any way with this episode and the gritty parts of the series, the sex and violence, that have become a trade mark of what has been a unique and entertaining series to this point, are utterly gratuitous, pointless and without merit.The most disappointing part of this episode might be the continuing irrelevance and diminishing significance of one of the best storyline and characters in the series, that of Daenerys Targaryen and her dragons. With each episode less time has been devoted to her and when she does appear, as in this episode, it seems to have no importance what so ever and her dialog is beginning to border on silly. Her appearance here seems to be little more than an after thought.There seem to be a lot of fanboy types marking this episode up and giving it glowing reviews but don't believe them. Amongst the friends, family and co-workers which my wife and I talk about this show on a regular basis there's been universal disappointment with the episode especially as the season finale.So much so that I can't help but wonder if HBO and the show's producers didn't inflict a mortal wound on the series with this disaster. We won't see another installment until 2014 and our own sentiment is reflected in the answer to the question we've asked of everyone we've talked with; what are you looking forward to next season and the answer to a person is, nothing.This all seems very reminiscent of the progression of Battlestar Galactica, a terrible season 3 ending that left fans wanting, an extended period of time until the next season premiere in which people stopped caring and then the end.",

The writing was great and the small council scene was praiseworthy. But overall i was left thinking that nothing much happened and i did not get the last scene shock that i got from the first two seasons , i.e. the dragons in season 1 and the white walkers in season 2.All in all , i think i am just sad that there is gonna be a 9 month wait for the next season to begin.But the premise is set. Daenerys is stronger than ever , Jon Snow is back to the wall, Jaime back home, Greyjoys preparing to get Theon back , and most of all Stannis finally seeing the big picture .An EPIC season comes to an end .",

                    "content": "Whilst not quite continuing the show's streak of masterpiece episodes, the season 3 finale is a well written episode, that moves the pieces into place for season 4. The episode visits every principle character, gauging many of their contrasting reactions to the horror of the Red Wedding, whilst wrapping up several season 3 arcs nicely.The episode starts by dropping you right back into the horror of the Red Wedding. The decision to show the wolf's head attached to Robb Stark's body was wise and necessary, as it was a reminder of what a brutal world Westeros is and served to give the middle finger to animal rights activists, who can stomach the massacre of humans but not the murder of a CGI animal! Pod's reputation as a top stud has begun to spread, as he passes two women he's clearly boned before, on the way to calling Tyrion to a small council meeting, after Tyrion had bonded with Sansa. Charles Dance was brilliant as Tywin throughout this whole sequence, first sending Joffrey to bed before wisely informing Tyrion that a crown doesn't give you power. Tywin's admission that he wanted to cast Tyrion into sea at birth was cold, as well as being brilliantly acted by both Dance and Dinklage. Later on, Tyrion and Cersei's dialogue about happiness and children, was great at exploring the layers of Cersei, which were evident when Jaime returned.Bran's company took shelter in the Nightfort, with Bran telling a story that addressed a problem I forgot to mention last week. The story about the rat cook emphasised the importance of guest right, informing us of the severity of the atrocities committed at the Twins. In a crowd pleasing moment, Sam and Bran met up in a touching scene in which John Bradley did a superb job of convincing us of the concern Sam felt, at the prospect of his friend's brother heading North of the Wall.Roose Bolton and Walder Frey had a fantastically written and acted scene this week, as they devilishly embraced their respective positions. The dialogue about Robb's \"pomposity\" to which Roose responded \"Forever young\" was chillingly brilliant. All of this, led to the \"shocking\" reveal that the torturer is Roose's bastard. Although the show intended for this to be a shocking reveal, viewers had to have been pretty passive not to have noticed the numerous references throughout seasons 2 and 3, that eluded to this fact.Ramsey and Theon had an awesome scene this week, which began with Ramsey eating a penis shaped sausage, that had me convinced that he was eating Theon's junk. Iwan Rheon has done an incredible job of portraying Ramsey as a sick and twisted savage human being, which was again evident in this particular torture scene.The long awaited return to the Iron Islands, saw a great juxtaposition between the initial horror and the concluding hope. Theon's penis is delivered to his father in a small box. The conflict between Yara and her apathetic father was great here and ended in Yara promising to rescue Theon, in a refreshing departure from book canon.Despite my reservations, Shae's scene with Varys was surprisingly worthy of inclusion. Shae's decision not to accept Varys' offer of a new life, has set in motion some very interesting developments that will occur in season 4.Arya's awesome badassery was in evidence this episode. Moving her coin assassination to this stage in the story was fully justified, as we saw just how badly recent events had impacted on her. The Hound killed the other Frey's in devastating fashion, allowing him and Arya to continue on a fascinating journey, in which they're united as killers but distinguishable by their different motives for killing.Jon's story took an interesting turn when he was ambushed by Ygritte. Despite Harrington's inconsistent acting, Rose Leslie managed to save the scene by displaying the whirlwind of emotions that Ygritte is feeling perfectly. Jon getting shot by three arrows was excessive but, I'm glad to see that they didn't omit a crucial development in their relationship. Sam's return to the Wall brought with it the return of good old Maester Aemon. Highlighting the class difference between Sam and Gilly was at first amusing but now it's like the show feels the need to hit us over the head with it. Whilst Jon's reunion with Sam was heartwarming, the scene was undermined by the fact that it felt too much like a particular Lord Of The Rings scene.Unlike with Sam and Gilly, Davos and Gendry had an interesting conversation about class, as we were given a revealing glimpse behind Davos' background. The scene in which Stannis debated whether to follow Davos' or Melisandre's advice, was very clich\u00e9, as it was the classic devil on one shoulder angel on another scenario. Davos' decision to free Gendry remained consistent with Davos' character, which is a thing that the Walking Dead struggles at. Stannis' anger upon discovering this was well conveyed by Stephen Dillane, in a scene that foreshadowed Stannis marching on the Wall, which is the most exciting thing that this episode set up.Now onto the final scene. The first season we had the Dragons, the second season we had the White Walkers, the third season we had..... an advert for giving aid to Africa. The whole sequence of the slaves lifting her up, with the questionable music and that ridiculous aerial view, just made the scene feel like an advert for African aid or a Live 8 concert and I half expected to see Bono or Bob Geldof in the background. This scene didn't match the standards that this incredible show has set, yet despite that, you better believe that every day between today and the season 4 premiere will be painful!Best Quotes: Roose Bolton: \"Forever young.\" Tywin Lannister:\"You really think a crown gives you power?\" Arya Stark: \"Valar Morghulis.\"",

The thing I enjoyed the most of these episode is that we feel everything is falling apart, yet however, in the end, we leave with a sense of hope that things can and will get better.I was really glad to see Lord Balon Greyjoy (even thought at this point in the books he is already dead) reunited with Yara Greyjoy (Asha, in the books). He is a great actor, and he stands in the same way we saw him last season: undetermined to recognize Theon as his son. Yara on the other hand, at first was in the same position her father, but on her last appearance last season, we saw her soften to her brother. Now, we see her soften even more. There it is, that same \"hope\" again, hope that perhaps not everything is lost for Theon. The same thing happened with Cersei. We saw her mourning all the episode, yet that flash of hope is even in her face when she sees Jaime. Davos, same case. He is noble, and in this world we have come to know that being noble get's you killed. Yet however, lord Davos is again saved by that unlikely hope. Also, that interaction between Bran's group with Sam's left me emotionally satisfied. We again feel everything will be alright....even though we know where they are going.Perhaps the saddest thing of this episode was Arya, realizing she is now truly alone, perhaps even more than Sansa. And, of course, that scene between Jon and Ygritte, and their doomed romance coming to an end. We feel sad for him, yet again, when he sees Pyp and Sam, we really feel he is where he belongs. I also enjoyed that scene between Lord Walder and Lord Bolton for two reasons: David Bradley does a marvelous Walder Frey, and that tense introduction of Roose's son, Ramsay (if you did't catch who Ramsey is, you are slower than a mule)As I said in the beginning, I truly enjoyed this episode for the re-introduction of familiar faces. Master Aemon, you are a sight for sore eyes. As is the Wall's training yard. Wonderful this episode, we don't feel defeated, we feel empowered. Empowered for the next season, ready for new characters (I hope that D.B. and David introduce the Martells as quick as possible!) ready for the things to come. I used to criticize D.B. Weiss and David Benioff a lot, but with these last five episodes, they have proved to us the \"A Song of Ice and Fire\" die-hard fans that the book adaptation is in good hands.Said hands have ten months to work next....all we have to do is wait....Just 10 months....oh well.....",

However you will all be pleased to know, that Mhysa is a SATISFYING end to season 3 of Game of Thrones.I will not spoil anything for those who read this, but i will say this: Questions are answered... and new questions have formed. Also, some characters were left without any type of conclusion for season 3. In saying that though, the finale sets up the 4th season of Game of Thrones brilliantly and will have fans eagerly waiting for the next season. To sum it up, Myhsa is one of the better episodes of the series and satisfying conclusion to HBO's epic fantasy, even if it couldn't match the power and incredible scenes witnessed in \"The Rains of Castamere\"",

                    "content": "Firstly, I'd like to start by saying that I don't understand all the hate that this episode has been getting. Yes, I know, it's no \"Red Wedding\" but if this episode had been shown to people without the Red Wedding then they would consider it one of the best. So that's why I've called it one of the best.The episode starts with a great scene that directly follows the Red Wedding. The scene includes some nice shots of Stark flags burning but the most crucial thing about the scene was when The King in the North rode again (along with his Direwolf). This was the moment, for me at least, when we could finally accept that Robb Stark was dead and it's when Arya accepted the fact. Later on, we have to come to terms with Arya having lost everybody she loved and started her descent (or ascent) to being a killer.Then we come to King's Landing, where Joffrey is in glee at Robb Stark's death and decides it would be a good idea to feed his head to Sansa at his wedding. Tyrion stands up to the King and Joffrey starts to kick and fuss. Tywin decides to send him to bed. Then comes the best bit, Tywin's family teaching lesson to Tyrion and one of the coldest lines of the show, \"The day that you were born!\". Later on, more Lannister family teachings from Cersei as we learn how deep her character really is. Most of the time she is over the top evil but there are a few moments where she shows the greatest love out of anybody.After that we go to Bran telling a story about a cook who killed a guest in his house. Enter Walder Frey and Roose Bolton, discussing Robb Stark and the burning of Winterfell. At last, for those few viewers who didn't, we find out that it's Ramsay Snow who's torturing Theon. Theon's over-sized story arc this season is given reason when we return to Pike to see Balon given \"Theon's favourite toy\" and Asha (or is it Yara) venturing to rescue Theon. This was one of the episode's other great scenes and was, for once, a good diversion from the book.Continuing with Bran, we go back to the Wall where Sam gets south and Bran journeys to the Land-Beyond-the-Wall. But he doesn't leave alone, as Sam arms him, Hodor and Jojen with the Dragonglass he found at the Fist of the First Men. This has a beautiful shot of Bran going North with his Direwolf silhouetted against the moon. Meanwhile Sam gets to Castle Black and Maester Aemon returns!!! He is instructed to send 44 letters to the Lords of Westeros concerning the army of Wights and White Walkers. I'll talk about this later.Jon and Ygritte have a wonderful scene where it seems that there love is broken and Ygritte tries to kill Jon. Luckily, after three arrows, Jon gets to Castle Black for a Lord-of-the-Rings-esque moment. In other Westeros love news, !Varys! tells Shae to take some diamonds, head back to the Free Cities and live a long happy life. However, she opts to stay in the capital and refuse wealth. This is a significant turning point for Tyrion and is a story we'll see escalate at the beginning of Season Four.Nearly there.On Dragonstone, Davos talks to Gendry about growing up in Fleebottom and about getting from a river of sh*t outside you front door to becoming Hand of the King to the rightful King of Westeros. Because of their similarities Davos saves Gendry from Melisandre. This is completely in character and is what Game of Thrones is great for. He is nearly sentenced to death for his treason but is saved by Sam's letter about the dangers beyond the Wall and Melisandre convinces Stannis to work with her and Davos to defend the Wall. This will become one of the most important story lines and I'm really pleased with the set up it had for Season Four. The lighting in Davos' scenes and the music was truly great and was one of the best achieved parts of the whole season.Finally, and unfortunately, we have the final scene. We could have had Stannis' awesome speech or Joffrey's Purple Wedding but no we have Daenerys' Mhysa scene, the worst part of the entire episode. This scene was just disappointment through and through. There was only one redeeming quality and that was the music by Ramin Djawadi which was just beautiful. However, the whole scene was just underwhelming and, yes I know the word gets thrown around a lot now but, slightly racist.To conclude, this great episode, and great season, and great show, cannot be ruined by the lacklustre ending. The best parts were Davos' story, Tyrion's story and the Greyjoys' story (for once) and I would rate this episode 9.5 out of 10. The only thing I have left to say is, bring on Season Four!",

Except, wait, while I was watching I realized he's rowing-thus, facing backwards-so it's actually correct, the coast would be on his left.

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Two Swords\" may not be 'Game of Thrones' at its best, then again it is a season opener with character introductions and further plot advancement so things are not quite settled, but is a great start for Season 4. It does a fabulous job with introducing new characters and re-introducing past ones, while advancing what was shown before. One just wishes that more thought was put into the casting change for Daario, the lack of physical resemblance is too jarring and didn't feel like the same character.In terms of standout scenes, the highlight for me is the final one between Arya and Sandor. All the acting is superb, the always-never-less-than-great actors such as Peter Dinklage, Charles Dance and Jack Gleeson still shine, Sophie Turner has really grown as an actress and the new characters make a strong impression, Pedro Pascal particularly note-worthy. Direction is fine.Visually, \"Two Swords\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Two Swords\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.On the whole, great season opener if not quite a show high-point. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

This is a masterful encounter of tension, wonderful acting from all involved, excellent dialogue and choreography, and it's a shame that they didn't feature the same kind of quality in later seasons. Elsewhere, it's a King's Landing heavy story, with Oberon showing up to mix things up a bit and Tyrion more sensitive than ever.",

Daario Naharis that was played by Ed Skrein has been replaced by Michiel Huisman, who does not have any resemblance with the original actor. The impulsive Arya forces The Hound to fight again against a great number of opponents. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Two Swords\"",

                    "content": "As the fourth season opens we see that two characters, Jaime Lannister and Jon Snow, haven't received the welcome the hoped for when they returned to King's Landing and Fort Black respectively. Jaime is fitted with a new metal hand but he is clearly considered less of a man than he was when he was last in the capital. His father gives him a sword forged from the metal of Ned Stark's old sword and orders him to return to the family home at Casterly Rock but Jaime refuses insisting that he will remain in the King's Guard\u0085 even after the king mocks him. Jon Snow meanwhile is accused of betraying his vows and some of the senior Night's Watch believe he should be executed; luckily wiser counsel prevails after his warning of the uniting of the Wildling tribes under Mance Rayder.Other characters aren't neglected; in King's Landing we see that Sansa has taken the news of what happened to her family very badly and is refusing to eat. Tyrion is having difficulties with two women; his wife and Shae; the latter's attentions appear to have been discovered putting her in danger. If that wasn't enough Tyrion is given the task of greeting the head of House Martell, a house known for its hatred of the Lannisters. The man doesn't turn up, he has sent his younger brother Prince Oberyn Martell, and he has gone ahead and gone straight to a brothel. Elsewhere Daenerys learns that her dragons are not tame and had to deal with the fact that Daario Naharis and Grey Worm are competing for the right to ride alongside her; something that doesn't impress her. While all this is going on they head towards another slave city that she plans to liberate. In the North we see more Wildling groups meeting up as they prepare to attack Castle Black\u0085 including some who hope to feed on the crows! Finally Arya and Sandor Clegane meet a group of soldiers in a remote tavern; including the man who stole her sword 'Needle' and killed her friend with it\u0085 she will have her revenge!This was a really good start to the fourth season as we catch up with most of the main characters and we see that things aren't going as they had hoped. I almost didn't recognise Jaime when he first appeared as his long hair had gone; replaced by a more military cut. It was interesting to see how he was treated by his family; Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau has done a fine job as Jaime slowly changed from the arrogant but brilliant swordsman to a more modest and more likable character. There was less surprise in what happened to Jon Snow although his scenes did serve to remind us how the received wisdom about the Wildlings was far different from what Jon discovered. Seeing new Wildlings, in the form of a group of cannibals was enjoyable; these scenes with the Wildlings also showed that Ygritte isn't over Jon Snow. The episodes other new arrival was Oberyn Martell and it looks as if he and his family will prove an interesting addition to the story; now the Starks are defeated the Lannisters need a viable foe and the Martells sound like contenders. It was nice to see that Daenerys' dragons are growing fast and surprising to see one threaten her, if only briefly. The highlight of the episode however was the scene where Arya and The Hound meet the soldiers in the tavern; it started with a calm conversation but you could feel the tension rising like a rattlesnake preparing to strike\u0085 when the action started it was both thrilling and brutal. At first Arya just looks on but when she joins in she shows that she can kill with little difficulty; Maisie Williams did a great job in this scene. Overall a good episode that makes me think that this series will be a real treat.",

Cersei Lannister is frustrated because she is about to marry a \"pillow biter\".Danaerys frustrated by the mummies that line the road to her destination, Meereen.

                    "content": "Eventually I do plan to read the books because so much happens in just one episode that it is hard to even fathom what may have been cut out. That aside, most of the favorites are back for the season premiere. Tyrion meets the newest character, Oberyn Martell; Jaimie deals with the disappointment, you could say, of his return; Daenerys continues her march as freer of slaves; Sansa and Arya uniquely deal with the death of the majority of their family; and we even get to see Jon Snow.Topic 1: Those in War \u2013 Jon Snow & DaenerysTo begin, let's start with Jon Snow. With his return comes a trial for his betrayal of the night's watch and no mercy is given to the bastard, even with news of the red wedding causing him grief. However, with Rob's defense being he was ordered to kill Qhorin, a season or two ago, and this was to infiltrate the wildlings, he builds his case. He reveals they have united under Mance Rayder, and that they have surpassed the wall. Also he reveals he has had sex. Either way, thanks to the information, and Master Aemon saving him, he is allowed to live.Moving onto Daenerys, her dragons have become teenagers and, with this, they have become harder to control. This leads to the realization that while they are undoubtedly loyal, they are not her servants. Still though, she has bigger things to worry about then her dragons. For one, between Daario Naharis and Grey Worm, there seems to be quite a fight to ride alongside the queen, a battle which doesn't amuse her in the least bit. However, Daario does present something Grey Worm can't, and perhaps that is strategy beyond the concepts of war. He brings the idea of Daenerys to familiarize herself with the culture of the people, as well as its environment, and not simply be one who rules in ambivalence. Mind you, this is done while flirting.Topic 2: Those in Peace \u2013 The Lannisters & TyrellsIn King's Landing the wedding is only but weeks away, and it seems very few are excited about it. Sansa is consumed with grief, of which only a gift from Sir Dontos eases slightly; Jaimie is having a hard time from his family for between being captured, and having one hand, he is beginning to receive a similar type of admonishment as Tyrion has since birth. Albeit, Tywin still loves him enough to ask him to be lord of Castley Rock, and accept his refusal, but with Cersei giving him the cold shoulder, Joffrey mocking his lack of accomplishments, and Brienne on him about not taking Sansa somewhere safe, no one is really in his corner right now.But, while the Lannisters deal with internal issues, the Tyrells are almost solely focused on the wedding. Olenna especially since she seems more vested in it than Margaery. However, even with the joy of the wedding, Olenna finds no peace in her surroundings. For, after spats with Tywin, it seems she finds herself very cautious of things she says, much less what Margaery does. For the most part though, both are in some sort of marital bliss.Topic 3: Those Seeking Vengeance \u2013 Arya & OberynLeaving us with Oberyn and Arya. Let's talk about Oberyn first since he presents a more compelling story. You see, Oberyn, and his house the Martells, are very much an odd wedding guest. Their family used to be part of the royalty of King's Landing, well until the Targaeryn king replaced Oberyn's sister. But perhaps what is worth noting the most is what happened during the Sack of Kings. During this uprising, as Targareyn children were massacred, including those kin to Oberyn, so was his sister Elia, the former queen. In fact, Tyrion says, based on what he heard, she was raped and split in two, and with the Lannisters being a key element of the destruction of part of his family, he warns Tyrion, who is to welcome them, that it isn't just the Lannisters who repay their debts.Lastly, there is Arya. With her family, for the most part, dead, and her stuck with the Hound, she finds herself in a weird limbo. She is stuck with a man she rather despises, and yet has a good enough relationship with to trust with her life. As for the Hound's point of view, with Robb dead he just continues moving around the Stark line and now plans on taking her to Lysa to turn her in for some gold. But, that isn't before a little revenge. Before the intro plays they remind us of all the twist and horrors before this season. One of which is Polliver killing Lommy with Arya's sword, Needle, given to her by her brother. In this episode, Arya gets her revenge, with the Hounds help, and retrieves perhaps one of the few items remaining of her once noble house. Leaving her with two more to add to her body count, and an almost Ellie and Joel, from The Last of Us, type of relationship between her and the Hound.",

                    "content": "As the most anticipated season of Game of Thrones yet, everyone has been buzzing with hype leading up to this premiere, and I had very high expectations. The opening scene was grand, the comparisons to Ned's sword Ice and his subsequent downfall to Lannister pride and Tywin, standing menacingly as his tosses the symbolic wolf hide into the the fire. His conversation with Jaime set up my favourite character for a new season of twists and turns. We see him reject his heritage and rightful place at Casterly Rock, perhaps sensing that he belongs elsewhere. Much more to come from him. Nice to see the Dreadfort in the opening sequence, it is a joy to watch each time. Pedro Pascal as the Red Viper is magnificent, his initial scene portraying him as the seductive deviant and dangerous conspirator he is. His explanation and his excellent line \"The Lannisters aren't the only ones who pay their debts\" is great exposition to give us some backstory on the Martell and Lannister clash. Elaria Sand played by Indira Varma was equally seductive, yet I found the accent quite wanting. As with a big budget show like GOT, they are generous with their CGI of the dragons. I wouldn't have it any other way; they are very lifelike in their grace and ferocity. I hope they don't stress how dragons can't be 'tamed', seeing as Targaryens have done so before, even if it is part of Dany's struggle. Unlike many I was fond of the old Daario, who had arrogance written all over his face, though this one is quite charming in his own stead. New Daario is much nicer, though giving flowers is a bit clich\u00e9. The one handed slaves hint at Dany's campaign to get a lot more difficult for her. Let's just say they took a different direction with Shae from the books and it could be a vast improvement, or it could be disaster. Her oblivious nature to the politics of the situation is hard to watch. Sansa is wonderful in laying out the bare bones of her tragedy. She seems to be on a whole new level of maturity and that hopefully will see fans grow on her. Cersei is as vivacious in this new season as she was in the last. The conflicting 'come in' and 'go away' was a great way to show how at odds the pair now are. Leslie Rose as Ygritte brings so much more than the books that I am glad to see more of her. The Magnar of Thenn is amongst the most meaning characters we have seen yet, towering over Tormund. I didn't like how they cut up the relationship between Jon and Robb, even though they rarely got any lines with each other. His reaction to the RW was not as good as Sansa's. I hope people noticed Janos Slynt at the Wall, as he is the first sign of the capital trying to influenced the Night's Watch. Master Aemon is as wise as ever, only rivalled by the Queen of Thorns. She again captivates the screen with her cutting cynicism and wit. You can see shades of this in the beautiful Margaery. Again, the standout actor in Gleeson is despicable and I love it. The appearance of the White Book of the Kingsguard I hope signals one of my favourite scenes. The Hound and Arya make for great dialogue and dynamic. You can sense Sandor already warming up to her. The actor for Polliver was a bit expressionless, but McCann more than made up for it with his carefree insults and ferocity in the fight scene. And what a way for Arya to make her next kills, absolutely brutal. Mirroring the Lommy scene and what we didn't get from the book (Tickler interrogation stabbing). Other than that, what else it there to say? We didn't even see the whole cast but you can be sure they Littlefinger and Varys are plotting behind the scenes, and Stannis is never far away. Great start to the season. 9/10",

There aren't any faults I have with this episode because it's a classic and it's a great start to Season 4.The performances are still great, the storyline/script is even more fresh, the pacing is superb and doesn't drag, the relationships continue to shine, the scenery is gorgeous, the CGI graphics is really solid (even the look of the dragon in Daenerys' story-arc, which looks pretty cool), the action is really interesting, the music score is still beautiful, and the directing is terrific. So, overall, a great start to the fourth season. :)",

I found many of the story lines this week to be of interest, particularly Jamie's and Arya's.I've always been a fan of Jamie Lannister, even from the beginning of the series. The incest storyline has always interested me, and his development throughout Season 3 was one of that season's strong points for me. I loved the way his character progressed, and I loved the relationship he built, and currently has, with Brienne. It's interesting to see Cersei giving him the shoulder and Joffrey blatantly disrespecting him, calling him out on his absence from King's Landing and his missing hand. If anything, that showed not only Joffrey's wickedness, but also Jack Gleeson's sadistic acting abilities. The second storyline I'm finding significantly interesting is Arya's. Arya has not consistently intrigued me as much as Jamie and other characters have, but last season, Arya definitely became a highlight. Her storyline was my favourite this week, with a great blend of amazing writing, brutal violence, and great character work. The writing in that pub scene felt like something out of a Tarantino movie \u2013 a slow build up to a violent conclusion. The sense of dread and violence was palpable in that scene, and it came as no surprise when things went south. The scene was exciting, and the violence gruesome, especially when the Hound slammed that man's head on the sword multiple times. If anything, this show is consistent in its gruesome, realistic depictions of violence. I could watch The Walking Dead and its violence all day and never be phased, but Game of Thrones has always surprised me with how I react to its violence \u2013 it is always twisted, gruesome, and painfully realistic.I also love what the writers seem to be doing with Arya. The ending of this episode was fantastic, with Arya riding off on her new pony, smile on her face, when only minutes ago she stabbed a man through the throat, gleefully happy as she was doing it. Arya seems to be falling down a dangerous path, one of psychopathy. I am greatly looking forward to seeing how the writers play with this character and what becomes of her sanity.",

Nice to see Jon Snow still running his own show, although I liked the idea of him leading 100,000 soldiers instead of going back to the bottom of the barrel with the people who are about to be overrun on the wall.The inbred rat is so inbred his own dad hates him.Arya seems pretty lucky to have ended up with the Hound of all people. It seems pretty nice to have a heartless killer on your side with the way things are going. And Arya is actually turning into one of those herself it seems.",

Finally we're starting to have some satisfaction after all the bloodshed of last seasons, finally we're getting some justice and vengeance done. It's payback time, and I think that's what this season will be all about. Redemption for the viewers, and fans, of all the previous seasons. I hope this will be one of the best seasons, if not the best, of GoT. This episode delivers and makes you have hope again.Winter? no... Reckoning is coming.",

I was impressed after viewing the first episode, because I found a parallel in between the title \"Two Swords\" (and the actual forging of them) and the storyline of this episode. Don't know whether this was just making up in my mind or whether the author intended to do this:Two Swords - Two Atmospheres1. Wrath - Anger - Hate: The Hound, Arya, Daenerys, Oberyn, Mance Rayder, The Wildlings2. Desperation - Sadness - Pride: Jaime Lannister, Cersei Lannister, Jon Snow, Shae, TyrionCan't wait for more!2 thumbs up!",

As GRRM still on the 6th book of the \"a song of ice and fire\" series, the producers are in no hurry to catch up to him, as each of their yearly season is based upon each book Martin wrote in quite a lot of time. Seeing as the producers have to cover up a \"storm of swords\" that was half left with the end of the previous season, I'm quite sure they think of covering up this book as well as the next in the series \"A feast for crows\" . With 10 episodes each year, they can fill up as many gaps as they can and try to go with the books but going according to the pages will be quite a lot of work and since each season has an yearly gap between it , this idea would seem impossible. Furthermore the 4th season of Got began with a good start as they have to cover up a lot of story in coming 9 episodes, let's just hope they deliver 180 days of shooting with pure excitement.",

There is anger, there is emotion, there is gluttony, greed and not give a f**k woven in this person that screams attention. On the other hand, I see same old pattern of bringing new characters from out of nowhere to keep the drama rolling, old ones staying just as bad and uninteresting as they were from their first scene. Well okay, maybe Tywin Lannister still performs well his cruel duty toward family greedy goals but rest is just sad. Oh yeah, \"F***k the King!!!\"!",

In my opinion, yes.The opening scene involving Tywin burning down Ned Starks great sword 'Ice' and its symbolism of the downfall of house Stark was brilliant. Also, Jaime (Nikloaj Coaster-Waldau) and Tywin's (Charles Dance) scene where Jaime defies Tywins wish for him to leave the Kingsguard was excellently acted and very well written.When I first discovered that we would not get to see the scene from the books, involving Tyrion and Oberyn riding towards Kings Landing I was slightly disappointed. However, Oberyns opening scene portraying not only his seductive and charming nature, but his short temper and ability to out think and pace his opponent was fantastically done. In my opinion Pedro Pascall is a brilliant choice of actor to play Oberyn, and Ellaria Sand was quite convincing also.My opinion on the new Daario Naharis (Michael Huisman) is currently unsure, he seemed very charming and well spoken, however not quite as cocky and arrogant as I always imagined Daario, however as usual Daenerys had minimal screen time therefore I am going to reserve my judgment on him for the time being.Cersei was brilliantly portrayed (as usual) by Lena Headey.I was glad to see Ser Dontos finally arrive, however I am unsure as to how much his and Sansa's story lines are going to differ from the books.Jack Gleeson once again manages to put in a perfect performance of King Joffrey.The stand out scene for me had to be that involving Arya (Maisie Williams) and Sandor (Rory McCann). Both excellently acted and one of the few fast paced scenes in the episode. Arya's descent into savagery is slowly becoming more and more prominent and I personally think it is being done very well.Overall I give this episode 9/10, it was very well done and could have been made better only by involving a bit more action, but you can hardly expect every episode to be as fast paced as 'The Rains of Castamere' now can you.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.While \"Two Swords\" was a great start to Season 4, \"The Lion and the Rose\" is an even better episode. To me and many others, judging from the universal (or near) critical acclaim, it is a high-point of 'Game of Thrones', up to this point and ever, and as close to a season magnum opus as one can get. It has everything that makes 'Game of Thrones' the brilliant show that it is, and manages to deliver even more than that.Joffrey's wedding is one of 'Game of Thrones' greatest moments, while \"The Lion and the Rose\" contains one of the most shocking, yet also somewhat satisfying, deaths and twists in 'Game of Thrones' history. Even when character and dialogue heavy, the tension and nuances simmer.The acting is typically without complaint, but the acting honours here go to Peter Dinklage, who has never disappointed as Tyrion, and a chillingly repellent Jack Gleeson.Visually, \"The Lion and the Rose\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Lion and the Rose\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All in all, a brilliant episode and a 'Game of Thrones' high point. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The earlier scenes are themselves involving, engrossing and gripping, involving political machinations in a post-Robb Stark world, but it's the last 20 minutes where this goes all out (and George R.R. Martin's scripting comes into its own). The Purple Wedding is infamous for its climax, but the preceding minutes of humiliation and bad behaviour are incredibly tense and edge-of-the-seat thrilling. GAME OF THRONES at its best, then.",

His arbitrary treatment of others and his impulsive use of power were wonderfully evil. I had assumed all along that he would die, running from a battle. At his own wedding, he was at his worst, humiliating Tyrion and showing his lack of feeling for his subjects. This is great theatre! as a good friend would say. No holds barred on these HBO productions. Other significant events take place. Shae, Tyrion's love, has apparently been shipped out. She brought this on herself (but have we seen the last of her). Cersei has put the blame on Tyrion for her son's death. Of course, the circumstances would make it look doubtful, though nothing is very fair or just in this series. All the events that led up to his demise were orchestrated by Joffrey. Jaime is a shadow now and is learning to use his sword left-handed. There is a scene with Theon and the sadist where the latter is in such control that he allows Theon (Reek) to shave him with a straight razor. There seems to be some realization going on in closeups of Theon's face. Something's up, but I'll have to wait and see. Since I am not peeking ahead, it makes me wonder what is going to go on with the new queen. Is she now the most powerful person in the kingdom. Incredible episode.",

In \"The Lion and the Rose\", the cruel and despicable Joffrey has the end that he has deserved, dying after drinking poisoned wine. Tyrion certainly did not poison him, and who might have? My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"The Lion and the Rose\"",

We soon learn that his father is far from happy with what was done to Theon as he intended to ransom Theon but no one will pay for him now. Melisandre is sacrificing more people so that the Lord of Light may help Stannis. North of the wall Bran is using his worg powers more and has a vision about where he must go after touching a Weirwood tree.Back in the capital Tyrion helps his brother Jaime by arranging for him to spar with Bronn so he can learn to fight left handed. Tyrion also arranges for Shae to leave the city; he is doing it because he knows that she is in imminent danger but to make her willing to leave he must make her think he no longer cares for her.Most of the episode is given over to the wedding of King Joffrey and Margaery Tyrell. Once the ceremony is over the post wedding celebrations begin as does the unpleasantness. Joffrey continually mocks his uncle Tyrion; chopping up his gift with his new sword; having a play featuring a troupe of dwarfs perform a 'recreation' of the war and finally forcing Tyrion to act as his cupbearer\u0085 all the while we see the other guests looking on with disgust at Joffrey's actions. All this leads up to the moment Joffrey starts choking, turns a shade of purple then dies in his mother's arms.This was a great episode; the early stuff was interesting and nicely reminded us of what various characters were up to\u0085 however all that is overshadowed by the events at the wedding. Jack Gleeson fine performance as the odious King Joffrey made him one of TVs great villains\u0085 and as much as it was great to see him finally get his comeuppance his character will be missed. The method of his death means we now have a mystery; who administered the poison? Cersei accuses her brother Tyrion but there are plenty more people with greater reason to want him dead and Tyrion couldn't have known that he'd be forced to act as Joffrey's cupbearer. The lead up to his death was distinctly uncomfortable as most of the other guests are shocked by Joffrey's behaviour. We also see his mother's pettiness as she orders the leftovers from the feast be given to the dogs\u0085 moments after the new queen has announced that they will be given to the poor of the city. Overall a top quality episode that almost rivals 'The Rains of Castamere'.",

From taking all the credit for the famous battle that Tyron lead when Joffery became yellow and ran. And I could go on, if you've seen the past seasons it is just a grocery list of misdeeds and sin.The whole Wedding party really has this uncomfortable and tense atmosphere where you just know in the back of your mind something bad is about to happen like a gunshot, but it was also the epitome of how much of a blowhole Joffery is. There was even a scene before the Wedding party that demonstrated this as we see Joffery just slice a book into pieces that Tyron gave to him as a present. This not just shows how much Joffery disrespects his uncle since his uncle loves books but it also shows Joffery is intellectually bankrupt. When you think about it there wasn't a scene where I saw Joffery enrich his mind in anyway, not just have I never seen him never crack open a book but also never even looked at one portrait. Not that this is really a big deal but it was something that I feel is part of the mindset of Joffery which is part of his downfall. It's kinda ironic that the book he destroyed is about Kings that have risen and fell.But of course we see Joffery express his blowholeness as he puts on some sort of mock play of the battle. Just seeing the look on Sonsa's face was heart sinking as that play was clearly an insult on the death of her father Ned Stark, but even some other characters found it less than enjoyable as we see even Tyron was offended as that play has twisted the facts of that battle.There is a really intense scene when Joffery tries to publicly humiliate Tyron. I loved it when Tyron don't bend to his insults and then Joffery tries to get his uncle to bend to his power by telling him to kneel and that he's his king, but Tyron doesn't. I thought that was great, sort of Tyron's way of saying I'm not taking you crap anymore. I cheered a little and thought way to go Tyron, just like him I don't bend to bully's, I don't give a crap if that bully is the President of the U.S. just because you have a position of power doesn't give you the right to abuse it. The fact Tyron didn't kneel, I feel was a moment where Joffery finally lost his power.And of course as the old saying goes what goes around comes around. I can't help but feel the way Joffery died is almost poetic justice as Joffery was a person drunk with power, you could say he finally choked on it and that power destroyed him in the end.Joffery reign in Westoros has finally ended, now he can reign in Hell.Rating: 4 stars",

                    "content": "This is the type of episode which makes you want to read the books, just so you can be ahead of the game. And though, supposedly, the writers are going to twist things to keep those who read the books off their tail, I doubt they can match the drama George R. R. Martin has concocted. Still, with that said, let's note what inspired such an opinion.Topic 1: A Father's Admiration \u2013 Lord Bolton, Ramsay, and TheonWith the Stark lineage mostly gone, Lord Bolton only has to conquer the straggling families of the north in order to claim their lands. However, with Ramsay mutilating Theon, he has perhaps created an enemy in the Iron Islands in the process. And with this part of the story, we see the issue most bastard children have, especially if they seemingly are the only male heir. They wish to impress their father, be one with them, but unlike Jon Snow, Ramsay Snow has barely any love coming from his father. But, with the north needing to be conquered, it seems Ramsay is given the chance to perhaps get some semblance to the family name. And with this opportunity comes a boyish grin on this odd psycho who goes off to impress his father.Topic 2: Short Appearances \u2013 Bran & StannisIn the episode, we do see Bran and Stannis, but nothing of serious note happens. Bran, we learn, has increasingly been using his powers to escape hunger, and paralysis. Something which worries Jojen for he fears Bran will eventually lose himself to being a wolf, and won't just forget his humanity, but them and all that has happened. But, he uses his power of vision one more time on a white tree and sees many flashbacks of what has happened, and now he is to look for someone, someone who maybe north.As for Stannis, he sacrifices his brother in law, a worthy ally, to the the Lord of light. Something Ser Davos doesn't understand, but with Melissandre being in a position of power, Stannis remains ambivalent to any warnings he hears. However, what doesn't fall on deaf ears is his wife's words against his daughter, a possible non-believer, who she thinks should be striked. Something Stannis is vehemently against, so his wife says Melissandre should speak with her, as she notices the chemistry between the two (Stannis and Melissandre). Now, as for Melissandre's conversation with Shireen, it is but a simple one informing her about their new gods, while she disregards the old ones.Topic 2: The Wedding \u2013 Joffrey & TyrionWith the wedding day here, Joffrey, naturally, is in high spirits and his ego is at its height. Leading poor Tyrion to much embarrassment, of which Margaery attempts to circumvent, with no help from Cersei or Tywin. But, while Margaery attempts to balance out Joffrey, Cersei makes her move on snitching on Tyrion's former lover Shae, of which Tywin is ready to keep his promise and kill. Thankfully though, Varys informs Tyrion in time to save Shae, leading Tyrion to saying the cruelest things imaginable to finally break their bond, and keep her safe.And seemingly he does this more for Sansa than himself. For while she may never love him, at the very least it seems they pity one another enough to be kind to each other. For example, during the wedding Joffrey decides to punish Tyrion for not joining a little people's performance by making him his cup bearer. He doesn't just allow Tyrion to do this simple job though, no Joffrey decides to drops his cup, kicks it around, and Sansa, delicately, helps her husband without turning attention to herself. Something which should be considered commendable since everyone else just watches in horror. Though I should note, Tyrion uses his skills in \"diplomacy,\" aka shade, to walk a thin line and insult Joffrey in front of everyone, leading to this punishment.Still, upon Joffrey catching Tyrion & Sansa trying to leave, he goes for one more moment. In this moment though, I had to rewind things repeatedly. For one, Margaery places Joffrey's cup toward her side of the table, near Lady Olenna, and not toward the Lannisters; Two, we never see Margaery eat from the pie her family bought for the wedding, though she feeds Joffrey plenty; and three, Tyrion takes a look at Olenna before giving Joffrey the wine he just drank from.And the reason these little moments matter is because, Joffrey seemingly gets poisoned. Which I find odd for the question is: Who did it? Cersei claims Tyrion did, which makes no sense. After all, Tyrion who has had so many better opportunities to kill Joffrey, in manners which would never lead to him being found out. And yet, he would do it at Joffrey's wedding? I mean, does Cersei take Tyrion for such a fool that she would forget the reason she didn't end up like Elia was because of Tyrion's abilities as a tactician? Take into consideration, if Stannis could be taken down by Tyrion with such careful planning, why would he use such a tactless measure to kill Joffrey?So, that leaves: The Tyrells, who have little reason to, outside of maybe getting revenge for Renly, since with Margaery just becoming Queen, and with no heir yet, that would be stupid; Oberyn Martell is a suspect, but it does seem like he is the type who would want it to be known he killed Joffrey, so I doubt it was him; Cersei and Tywin seem like good suspects, especially considering Tywin undoubtedly wouldn't mind being king, much less Cersei kills two birds with one stone by getting rid of Margaery's claim to the throne and killing Tyrion in the process. But, even with these theories, nothing really makes sense.",

                    "content": "The Purple WeddingThis review contains massive spoilers. Stay away if you haven't seen the episode. Well well well. As a book reader I have been eagerly awaiting this episode, but I was surprised when I saw that the wedding had been scheduled for number 2. Very early I must admit, but it makes for a nice change. The grand scenery and set is gorgeous with those red entwined poles symbolising the coming together of Lannister and Tyrell, the giant golden Lion and the stands. Jack Gleeson nails the book smashing scene. It sets up Tyrion's anger and prejudice at his own nephew because we all find Joffrey despicable. The allusion of the necklace was well placed last week and subtly shown on Sansa at the wedding. Very nicely done by Olenna, as well as her interaction with Tywin, seemingly warming up to him. Sigur Ros makes a cameo with Rains of Castamere, and I for one am not sick of it unlike Olenna. I hope they don't make Loras do something with Oberyn though. It would have been interesting for him to be in the Kingsguard as he should, mirroring the death of the one he is sworn to protect and his Tyrell lineage. I don't really like how Brienna is in love with Jaime, their relationship is much more interesting than that, but it does make Cersei jealous which creates a unique dynamic. Great banter by Oberyn, he steals every scene he is in. The dwarf jousting re-enactment is great. The actors are lively and the reactions of the subsequent houses create urgent tension from everyone, most of all Tyrion. A telling reaction by Sansa, Sophie gets better by each season. You could just tell Varys was loving every moment of it though. Joffrey's spat with Tyrion steals the scene leading up to the toast. It is neatly set up to frame Tyrion for the poisoned wine. Cersei and Joffrey make the choking scene what it is. Lena Headey has always been a brilliant actor and we really feel his despair and rage at Tyrion. The effects of the poison, whether they were CGI were fantastically grotesque. Farewell, Jack Gleeson. Good to see some Ramsay and Theon after missing them last week. Absolutely brilliant and acting from both of them, can't wait to see Reek's downward spiral. Alfie Allen nails the despair of his situation. Michael McElhatton is even more menacing than Ramsay, and that is saying something (Iwan's smile!). Every line is cold and remorseless as he puts his bastard in his place. Tyrion and Jaime never had this talk in the books but I love their relationship. It has always been some begrudging respect and admiration for each other, as seen when they actually meet in the cell in the books. Of course, that will change very soon. I am disappointed that Illyn Payne never got to spar with Jaime, those scenes could have done so much for Jaime's characterisation by narrating to a mute man. Bronn is just as good though, one of the characters that shines on the screen and is better than his book counterpart. If anyone hasn't figured out by now, Varys is on Dany's side. He was the one who suggested to sack Ser Barristan and send him to Essoss. I don't really know why he is sticking up for Shae but it is out of his ordinary characterisation. What's even worse was Tyrion suddenly wanting to ship off Shae. It sets up a very different relationship between them and I can't see them going the same way as the books now, which is disappointing. For once though, Sibel Kekilli's acting was great. The \"My Lion\" line will be heard later. I don't really like show Stannis that much. He is much too manipulable by Melisandre, when really that should be his wife Selyse's role as a servant of the Lord of Light. He is too cold and unforgiving, missing the sparse moments of emotion when he thinks of Renly or when he praises Davos. At least now he shows some love for Shireen. I really like them fleshing out Selyse earlier. Melisandre's delivery, like Stannis, has improved from her overly dramatic facial expressions from before. Again, they do a great job with Bran's wolf visions like they did in the earlier seasons. Immersive camera-work and sound which places the viewer right in the wolf's steps. Bran is probably the worst of the top billed actors, which is saying something, so I hope his acting improves. Isaac Hempstead-Wright has certainly aged which gives a more mature look to Bran. So I guess the dragon over King's Landing was really just a vision, which is good and probably threw a few fans off track. We won't see Cold-hands which is a shame, but Bran knows where to go now anyway.9.5/10",

It had a very satisfying twist at the end and I'll tell you why after I give this a lot of praise.The storyline here is well-written. The suspense, drama, and character study have been pushed to an even interesting level and it keeps your eyes open for anything to happen while the script is beyond flawless. The performances are still great and makes the characters even more believable. The music score is still beautiful, the scenery and sets are still gorgeous, the pacing, again, never drags, and the directing is really solid.Now that I've praised everything, I might as well say that the twist is what satisfied me the most. King Joffrey gets poisoned and dies right at the very end of the episode before Tyrion gets arrested. It not only shocked me, but made me feel happy. Because after everything King Joffrey has done since the first season, he finally deserved to die since he's considered by many to be the most despicable character in the entire show. The actor who played him, Jack Gleeson, did a fantastic job in making us hate him throughout the entire show. So I give my kudos to him for doing that task.So, overall, The Lion and the Rose is another classic episode and succeeds in every way possible.",

But yes, a villain you can hate that much to the point where they're always pissing you off. What was it like when he died? Everybody loved that and had been waiting for a while! This was a must! Wonderful. The drama in this episode is superb, the build up is amazing and its ending is wholeheartedly perfect. I enjoy this episode as one of the most in the entire series. Great episode and transitions into the next one so well. This is some peak Game of Thrones right here.",

That upon the end it was barely a surprise despite any horrific face.The episode relying on it's bastards to make an impression, goading us into our hate of them.The Bolton Bastard typically setting scene as psychopath. It would have been nicer to hear just how Roose Bolton was smuggled into his lands, undoubtedly taking the White Harbour ferry. Not quite as dramatic as proclaimed. Walda did make an impression as scary.Stannis his daughters screen time wasn't really felt as burning men or dramatic when executing former kin, but alas gull glue was a change of scenery from other bells.The Brandon scenes were well done adding some supernatural horror and style into what was fast becoming quite repetitive.The wedding itself was quite wrecked by Joffery's repetition and the many advert breaks on Atlantic painfully chopped each scene to a few minute intervals, debatable if the series had more air time between each. The wedding itself wasn't set at night so any fire jesters were quite wasted. Although the biggest WTF moment came from the vagina splits, shocking. Dinklage hasn't really set tones too well when looking so much worse for wear of late, rather then any of his former persona. The dwarf brigade didn't really tumble and were rather stolen with their hooting, when dry rubbing a teddy bear and mooning. By the end after suffering so many chops, hoping any finale had come minutes earlier. There was far too much of Joffrey to even care about what had seemed anti-climatic, as everybody hates him. I wouldn't have even put it past his own mother. Was it me or did Tommen gain a few years from any previous seasons? There was some great moments adding to the GOT charm and schemes, Tyrell manipulation, Cersei vehemence, the Dornish.Although a must watch episode in keeping with the story but overall quite bland.",

It starts good, then it goes a bit confusing, then we have a great wedding in the end, lots of more stuff is coming, be prepared. The bit I found disappointed it was that we have the end of one character that could have been much more and it's just an excuse for what is coming next, the emphasis is set on what happens next after this episode and not on the character that just died, although not very lovable it deserved something more shocking, at least a better reaction from the crowd and other important characters. Anyway it was very good ending.I have to say, though, this season it's starting to be the most satisfying of them all, let's hope it continues like this on a high note.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Breaker of Chains\" is a slight let down after the incredible \"The Lion and the Rose\", nevertheless it was an excellent episode. Can totally see where people are coming from regarding the much-talked about controversial scene, and while it is open to interpretation that doesn't stop me from not being the biggest fan of the scene respectfully. It was uncomfortable to watch and not only added nothing, other than reminding us of what Jaime is capable of, but didn't fit with the rest of the episode. Personal opinion though.Really liked the story development and direction it's going. It is very hard to follow on from an episode as special and emotionally impactful as \"The Lion and the Rose\" but \"Breaker of Chains\" does so very well if not quite as powerful. The tension and emotion are great, the storytelling absorbs and it is always great to see Daenerys getting meaty scenes and Cersei being more interesting than she has been in a while. Tyrion and Jaime are especially well written here. While all the acting is never less than fine, Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Lena Headey and particularly Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau are the standouts here.Visually, \"Breaker of Chains\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Breaker of Chains\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All in all, excellent. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

We know this is the case and he is being used as a scapegoat because no one likes his sarcasm and disdain for their ways. He is such a sympathetic character, carrying the weight of prejudice from all avenues. His new bride is now in the hands of Littlefinger who may be the baddest of the bad in this series. His duplicity is so calculating. He is biding his time. There is now an issue as to who is in charge, since the marriage to Joffrey was never consummated. Sersei and her father begin to set the stage for the other brother. Jaime, who one moment is admirable and the next despicable, has sex with his sister next to the body of the young king. This is a hard one to watch. Meanwhile, Dany has reached the evil city she has been marching toward and there is a great Indiana Jones type scene. The Hound and Arya continue to travel together and he continues his survival of he fittest thing with some poor farmer and his daughter who do him a kindness.",

The King is dead, but long live the King. The danger that is the presence of the traitors at Craster's Keep will force the Night's Watch to return the North to eliminate them.

                    "content": "This episode opens immediately after the events of the previous instalment; Tyrion is accused of Joffrey's murder and dragged off to the cells while Sansa is spirited out of the city by Dontos\u0085 but just what will happen to her now remains to be seen as the man behind her rescue was Lord Petyr Baelish; a contender for the title of most devious man in the Seven Kingdoms. With Joffrey dead Tywin wastes no time in preparing the young Tommen for the role of king\u0085 with himself remaining the power behind the throne. Tyrion is told he will be tried in a fortnight and warns his squire Podrick to get away from the city as quickly as he can.Away from the capital Arya is not pleased when Sandor Clegane abused the hospitality of a farmer his daughter who helped them. The Wildlings raid a village and sent a child to Castle Black to tell them what happened to draw the Night's Watch out of the castle; Jon warns against getting involved here but when it becomes apparent that the renegade members of the Watch who killed Craster are still at his keep he argues that they must deal with them immediately; if Mance Rayder gets there first and learns that there are a hundred men at Castle Black rather than the thousand soldiers Jon told him about it will be all over for them. At Dragonstone Stannis pressures Lord Davos to find a way for him to strike against the capital again. To the east Daenerys and her forces reach the city of Meereen where a challenge to one on one combat between their champion and hers is issued.While this episode wasn't as tense as the previous one there were still plenty of exciting moments. These included some fine action scenes as the Wildlings sacked the village and the brief fight between Meereen's champion and Daario. We are still no closer to learning who actually killed Joffrey; there are plenty of contenders. The news of the men at Craster's Keep was interesting as they appeared to have been forgotten and now they promise imminent action as the Watch head to deal with them. While not exactly thrilling the scenes of Sam trying to find somewhere safe for Gilly, away from Castle Black, were enjoyable as he represents the ordinary man; he may be in the Watch but he isn't a noble or even a great fighter\u0085 something that makes the others doubt his claim of killing a White Walker. Another highlight of the episode was the return of Lord Baelish; Aidan Gillen does a great job making this totally untrustworthy character so likable to the viewer. Overall another fine episode in what is shaping up to be a great season.",

                    "content": "As we are catapulted straight into the aftermath of the Purple Wedding, immediately there is a more frenetic feel. We haven't had much action in the first two episodes and the fast paced camera shots and music set the tone of the chaos nicely. Speaking of chaos, remember the ladder? Remember Petyr Baelish, better know as Littlefinger? The most devious man in Westeros is back, and with a few whispered sentences confirms what we have been speculating: he and Olenna conspired to poison Joffrey with the necklace. Furthermore, the next scene rules out Margaery as having any part in it. Can I just say Jack Gleeson nails his part, even in death? When I first saw those eye stones in the pilot, they were as freaky as they are now. Tywin is imposing as ever in his drilling of Tommen, the future king, how a Lannister ought to rule. You get the sense that Tywin with his stern words will once again make the Kingdom submit to his power and influence once again. Cersei in focus in the background creates the feel of a mother again seeing her child step out into a vulnerable situation. What came next was not what I was expecting. Jaime as my favourite character enters an arc after this period of redemption. Needless to say, half raping Cersei next to the dead body of their son does not give that impression and I am very disappointed in that. Perhaps they still seek to give a villain aspect to Jaime, something I disagree with vehemently. The pairing of the Hound and Arya is already a fan favourite and you can see why. You sense Sandor warming up to her by telling her his future plans and there is even an off reference to Daario's Second Sons. The Tully and the farmer bit on Arya's part was a nice touch to show that the commoners still hold allegiances while the war is over. It is so easy to forget that there are those common folk also affected by the larger players of the game of thrones. And we haven't seen Arya smile like that in a long, long time. Of course, the Hound is still the Hound, and we are reminded of just how the war has ravaged everyone. It's good to see Arya still upholding her morals amidst all the killing. Gilly and Sam are two of the most humble and honest characters of the show, to give some balance and we see a brief lull of peace in Castle Black. Sam and his fat pink face is still the kind person we know, even after killing that White Walker. It's a nice way to show how much he cares for Gilly and introduce Mole's Town as well. A sneaky reference to the Golden Company but Stannis is still as hard headed as ever, even with Mel on his side he is powerless in this struggle after Joffrey's death. I suppose it's a good chance to further flesh out Davos and Shireen for the future, and of course the Iron Bank of Bravos is going to feature as the break out card for Stannis. Mark Gatiss awaits them. As for sexposition, I still can't get over how good the casting of Pascal was for Oberyn, even in a orgy scene he is perfect. I trust that none of us will forget his sexual preferences after this. Of course we already know who did it, so Tywin is grasping at straws, but it does serve to again emphasis the tension between the Lannisters and the Martells, even with Tywin's attempt to broker an alliance, of sorts. Can't wait for that trial. And Oberyn is a poison master, something new that we learn. It's nice to see that Pod is still being the only friend for Tyrion. Perhaps they may build on that in the future, it is certainly more emphasised than in the books. The most important thing is that he believes Tyrion is guilty. The more people who believe this, the more chance Tyrion has of escaping this mess. I actually got chills as they said their farewells, it is very touching that Pod still thinks of Tyrion so highly despite his circumstances. The ominous man pulling the strings of the poison may be LF and Olenna, but a certain eunuch still has not featured much in this season. I hope Varys soon makes his own mark on this unfolding story. The wilding raid of the village is short but well done, with the ominous music and the Magnar of Thenn once again stealing the screen with his presence. I do question the tactic of warning Castle Black they are coming, even if Jon already knows. Thorne and Jon both do a good job here in rallying the NW to prepare for the upcoming battle. Jon it seems has matured since his ranging beyond the Wall. I wonder how he and Ygritte will eventually meet again. Ending up in the East, Meereen finally beckons Dany and her army. The CGI city is gorgeous and a spectacle to look at, the massive gates a reminder of those of Troy. I'm still not sure what I make of new Daario, but he did the job quite nicely and certainly won't have trouble keeping up with the likes of Jorah and Barristan. The wink was a nice touch. 8.5/10",

                    "content": "Breaker of Chains was certainly a slower episode than the previous three, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. After Joffrey's death, a shocking event reminiscent of a season finale, it's evident that these next couple of episodes will be a little slower, building more plot and character to fill-in the kingship and give everyone time to move their chess pieces a little more.There were many focuses in the episode \u2013 Sansa being rescued by Littlefinger, Cersei mourning Joffrey and being raped by Jaime, Tyrion being locked in the basement, Oberyn and Tywin discussing their history, Sam and Gilly's protection storyline, Stannis and Davos, The Hound and Arya, and finally, finishing the episode, Daenerys and her slaves.So, while the show encompasses many of the world's characters and advances their story, the downside of focusing on so many characters is that some of the story lines are bound to fall flat. Cersei mourning and subsequently being raped by Jaime was a silly scene. Tywin's \"What Makes a Good King\" speech was amazing, with a great performance by Charles Dance, but Cersei had little to do but stare at her son with those silly pieces of wood with painted eyes on them. After Tywin and company leave, Jamie comes in, they have an awkward conversation, and Jamie subsequently rapes Cersei. It seems to be an unnecessary scene, and we'll see the outcome of it in future episodes, but the scene itself seemed silly and melodramatic. Why is Jaime raping Cersei? It was disappointing to see, as Jaime has developed so much as a character throughout Season 3 that I've come to like him, but then he goes and rapes Cersei, and as much as I hate her as character, it was too mean and sadistic to watch. It completely devolved Jaime's character and development. I was excited to see where his character was going, as he seemed to be disowning the Lannisters and growing into his own isolated character, but now he's back to loving Cersei and having sex with her. It's possible he was trying to hurt her, but raping your sister while laying next to your dead son's corpse was a new low for not only Jaime, but maybe even the show in general.Another scene worth discussing is Tyrion's imprisonment in King's Landing. Tyrion, now sporting a five o'clock shadow and forced to wallow in his own poop, he has reached a new low. What is always amazing to me is how noble Tyrion is and how brave he is in regards to how other's perceive him. His scene with Podrick was a touching one, especially at the end when he tries to protect Podrick by making him leave King's Landing due to his fear of Podrick's death. Podrick is his one true ally at this time (Bronn is in questioning, too), and he allows Podrick to disappear for the safety of his own life rather than use him as a pawn in his testifying against killing Joffrey. Podrick was arguably his only remaining move for his defence, and now that he's gone, it shows not only that Tyrion is in deep trouble, but also that he's noble and selfless enough to forego his own life in exchange for a younger, more ambitious one, and I love him even more now for it.The final scene worth discussing (this would be too long if I discussed all of them) is Daenerys'. This was another scene I was not particularly fond of. Emilia Clarke has never been the greatest actress, and her \"Queen\" Daenerys\" scenes have always come across as kind of awkward and non-threatening. Daenerys is supposed to be young but intimidating, but Emilia Clarke's performance has never portrayed this correctly. Instead, it seems far too forced, and it makes Daenerys appear more questioning or not as confident as she should be. Another detractor from the scene is that we have seen this scene about five times in the show now. Daenerys' storyline needs to start getting a move on, and soon. Yes, her takeover of Astapor was badass and a highlight of Season 3, but now we've seen her intimidating cities two more times, and it's getting quite old. I don't need to see Daenerys building her army of slaves (sorry, free men) any more; I get it, she has a large army and she's powerful and fearful. While it may have worked in the novels, it is coming across as boring, meandering, and even repetitive in the show. What was supposed to be a badass ending to the episode instead left me yawning and wanting some more development for her story.Many of the scenes this episode were great. Arya and The Hound had funny moments, but they're back to be antagonists again, continuing the theme that we seem to be going in circles. Sam and Gilly's storyline was also a little boring, and Sam's argument about her protection from the Night's Watch was ridiculous. In my opinion, she would actually be much safer with them, and at least there Sam could keep an eye on her personally. Stannis and Davos' scenes added nothing to discuss.The best scene of the episode was easily Littlefinger and Sansa. It added great intrigue to the episode, it gave us a potential killer of Joffrey in the duplicitous Littlefinger, the dialogue was fantastic and dramatic, and the cinematography of the scene was spectacular, with the fog adding a sense of dread to the already near-pitch black darkness of the ship.Overall, it was a good episode, if a little meandering and boring. I realize that now that Joffrey is dead, the show needs to lay some more groundwork for its upcoming episodes, and that's fine. I just wish it could have been done a little more entertainingly.",

I only want to comment on the most shocking and controversially scenes, and in this episode it was the \"raping\" scene as some people call it. although in my opinion it was necessarily disturbing as it is intended to be. lets go back few season back and look at the relationship between jaime and cersei. cersei likes to play victim and sometimes resist jaime when he comes at her (remember the scene when she slapped him in season one then he grip her hand and held her tightly and said \"I will kill the whole bloody lot of them until you and I are the only two people left in this world\" cersei melted at this although jaime had just attempted to murder a 10 year old child!! jaime is used to take charge on their relationship and he always does and cersei loves it.now coming back to the question, but why now? on their dead son body? because jaime is a very angry person who is very passionate about his sister (when he attempted to kill Bran in season one, he did it without hesitating after looking at cersei's face, and he said \" the things i do for love\". cersei is his only weakness and he wanted her for days now because she is the only person in the world who makes him feel better, and in this moment he was very angry and fed up about everything (he just came from a very long journey of him being humiliated and captured as prisoner, he lost his only valuable thing, the only thing he was good at, his hand, and his only true love doesn't want him anymore). so with all those very angry feelings he got blinded and exploded the only way he knew that made him feel better before (his love cersei). this was his very disturbing way to feel better. we have to understand that people are different, not all of us are normal, and jaime and scersi are indeed not. they are the most narcissist people, that they actually love each other and they are very convinced about their love even though they are siblings, only because they love themselves the most so they see themselves in one another!!! the way they reflect their feelings is different than any normal person, so i think the writers did a great job portraying this aspect of their characters. isn't this why we love GoT !! for all the disturbing actions!!!I feel that some people got to love jaime in season 3 because they sympathized with him, but they forgot who he actually is. this is why I loved this scene, because it reminded us of real jaime (who is still one of my favorite characters) and i really thank the writers for being true to the characters no matter how it pisses people off.",

We don't know that yet, but what we do know is that many of our beloved have fallen this ladder.Now comes Tyrion, We all love the noble imp and no one wants to see him dead for some thing he did not do. we do hope that he doesn't slip his foot off this climb. Cersei loves her children , but no more than Jamie loves her. Yes, we saw Jamie loving a \"HATEFUL WOMAN\"..Oberyn Martell on the small council? Yes, How convincing of you Lord Tywin, Of course the richest man in Westeros gets what ever he needs even if he has to bargain one of his own .. \"The mad dog of Tywin Lannister\". we would really love to see Oberyn and Gregor Clegane meet, quite a moment that would be, as the prince of Dorne wants revenge for his late sister. The mountain killed her and her children on the orders of Tywin Lannister. the master commands and the dog obeys. someone like Oberyn would not let that pass. Bad blood between the two families??? YOU BET!!Furthermore we saw Sansa and Arya the two stark girls , each on their separate paths. Lord little finger is not that little after all , his love for the mother of the girl still lives as we saw him planning her escape from the snake's pit also known as King's Landing. Lucky Sansa but not so lucky Ser Dontos , of course Peter Baylish doesn't want to leave any lose ends , the guy is cold hearted as always. Giving Dontos the reward for his struggle by putting an arrow through his face. Let's wait and see what he really means to do with the stark girl. On the other side Sandor Clegane wishes to take Arya to her aunt, more like sell her to her aunt. Blood brothers these two, Sandor and Gregor and the blood is not so nice after all.That is no way to treat someone who gives you food and shelter , well what can we say , we all kind of expected that.The Wildings are also on the move as they make their way towards castle black, killing humans is what they're good at OR eating them , well if you're a \"THENN\" the clan who just joined Tormund and his band. Will there be a war? will Jon and Ygritte meet again? Is castle black ready for them? let's wait and find out.Daenerys and her children reach Meereen and there is no welcome party? how rude of you Meereen.... OH WAIT! yes there is and it's not so welcome also it's not a party , The champion of Meereen has no right to humiliate the mother of dragons , speaking of dragon we didn't see them .. where were they? probably hunting or something. Now back to the champion , yeah so the champion was no match for the charming Daario , Don't we all think he really loves her? OH... Ser Jorah will not be so delighted. Furthermore after Daenerys's arrival speech she fired barrels into the city which contained broken chains and thus the title of the episode was born \"BREAKER OF CHAINS\".",

It was a nice to see Littlefinger for the first time this season. Funny how he was completely out of the picture and yet made plans to rescue Sansa long before the wedding( Yes rings a bell now, doesn't it? )Lord Tywin seems happy that he can finally rule the kingdom and teach Tommen how to be King, something he missed out on with Joffrey(Would've been hilarious to see him describe how to consummate a marriage)The wildlings seem menacing since the introduction of the Magnar of Thenn. Can't wait to see how the Rangers defend Castle Black against the inevitable attack. Oberyn Martell looks every bit prepared for payback. Him facing the Mountain , now that's something to look forward to.Arya & the Hound are awesome together, like usual. Hound is probably the most honest and straightforward character in the show. His methods despite being harsh, stand true to the saying \"Survival of the fittest \" ( My favorite character )Tyrion/ Pod sequence was perhaps the most touching one in this episode. One almost forgets how much empathy Tyrion has even though that's what gets him in trouble more often than not. Knowing Tyrion, a fortnight is NOT all he's got.The landscape of Meereen was stunning and lived up to the hype. Daenarys seems poised in her quest and i quite liked the finishing touch with the broken chains. Overall, this episode sets up really well for what should be a chaotic,gripping and intense second half of the season.",

His whole character arc that has been building up from season 1 until now actually, is just thrown away in one scene, u know the one. But the ending was amazing. I love Dany so much and we haven't seen her very much this season, I hope that will change in the following episodes",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Personally don't agree with the negativity here respectfully, though can understand the disappointment. There are significant deviations from the source material, more so than usual for 'Game of Thrones', which fans have understandably have considered this a detriment for future episodes and story progression and for continuity's sake. This wasn't a big problem for me actually, being somebody who always judges something as a standalone, something that \"Oathkeeper\" does a great job in from personal opinion.\"Oathkeeper\" does have a lot of characters and goings on, and do sort of agree that it would have been better if what happens in the episode was told over more than one episode (two or three) so that everything felt consistently fully formed. However, the story is thoroughly absorbing even when more subdued than the previous episodes, going at an assured pace, having action that leaves one in awe and having some consistently surprising and intriguing story development (yes there is some here). That for the truth behind Joffrey's death is especially a shock.Acting throughout is strong, especially Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Diana Rigg.Visually, \"Oathkeeper\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Oathkeeper\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Altogether, another very strong instalment though will divide fans, particularly regarding its treatment of the source material. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Although this is only a minor sub-plot in the scheme of things I find the way it's handled to be superb, with plenty of drama, tension, and great performances from Burn Gorman and Noah Taylor who make the most of every second of their screen time. Elsewhere, Natalie Dormer is exceptional as Margery makes new conquests, and the character work for Sansa, Littlefinger and Jaime is all very fine.",

He also knows about her incestuous trysts with her brother. She has gone into protective mode for her remaining son, feeling he may also be in danger. He gets a nocturnal visit from Margery who plays on his adolescent being. He is not like his brother, at least at this point, but he has to know that Grandpa is pulling the strings. Meanwhile, Dany and the gang finally arrive at the Meereen fortress and her forces sneak in and gain the trust and aid of the slaves. Those who crucified slave children pay a price for their evil as well. Brienne is enlisted to find and save Sansa. There are numerous other things going on including a group of cannibals joining forces with the Wildings, doing horrible things to people just for their own evil purposes.

Meanwhile, Bran and his friends are captured by the mutineers. Jaime trains with Bronn that begs him to visit Tyrion in the dungeon that convinces his brother that he is innocent. Oleanna has a conversation with Margaery and gives advices to her. Jaime asks Brienne to find and protect Sansa and gives her a special gift. Then she travels with Pod as her squire. Sansa discusses with Littlefinger and accuses him of murdering Joffrey and he admits that Tyrion is innocent and Sansa has participated of the assassination of Joffrey. \"Oathkeeper\" shows Daenerys increasing her army with more slaves. Jon is organizing a party to kill the mutineers and he does not know that his brother is prisoner of the bad guys. Jaime has changed his behavior after losing his hand and the Kingslayer without honor attitude helping Brienne to keep his word is impressive. The despicable Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous characters of King's Landing. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Oathkeeper\"",

                    "content": "As this episode opens Daenerys liberates the slave city of Meereen when her Unsullied sneak in to the city through the sewers and arms the slaves. Once in control with the Targaryen banner flying over the citadel she ignores the counsel of Ser Barristan and has the same number of slave masters crucified as there were crucified children on the city's mile markers.Back in King's Landing Jaime comes to believe that Tyrion is innocent and when Cersei asks him to hunt down Sansa he refuses\u0085 indeed he later gives his Valarian steel sword to Brienne and asks her to find Sansa and act as her protector; he also requests that she takes Podrick as the capital isn't a safe place for friends of Tyrion. Meanwhile Sansa has a talk to Lord Baelish about why he rescued her and learnt how she inadvertently helped in Joffrey's murder. We also learn who administered the poison and why. With her new husband dead Margaery pays a visit to his brother, the future king, who she will now be expected to marry. At the wall Jon Snow prepares to take a small force of volunteers to kill or capture the mutineers at Craster's keep\u0085 who are about to capture Bran and his companions.This was another fine episode; it opens well with the liberation of Meereen and Daenerys's refusal to listen Ser Barristan and show mercy might be an indication that she is becoming too harsh to those she doesn't approve of\u0085 although what those who ran the city did makes it hard to feel too much sympathy for them\u0085 at least within the context of 'Game of Thrones'. The action in King's Landing continues to be intriguing as we learn of Olenna Tyrell's part in Joffrey's death; Dame Diana Rigg is great in this role. Natalie Dormer is also great as her granddaughter Margaery; the scene where she visits young Tommen was a delight as she is simultaneously sweet and seductive. Jaime continues to become one of the series more likable characters as he defies his sister and asks Brienne to protect Sansa. North of the wall Burn Gorman is delightfully vile as Karl Tanner, the leader of the mutineers at Craster's Keep\u0085 it is clear that things are even worse for Craster's wives now and he poses an immediate threat to his prisoner Bran. Finally we get a great scene where we learn what the White Walkers do with Crastor's sons.",

                    "content": "Despite various media articles about last week's rape scene, there isn't much sign that what we may perceive as rape, will be treated as rape. Besides that, there isn't much to note besides the redemption of Jaime and us learning who killed Joffrey. However, even with that said, there are a few gems which do sparkle.Topic 1: The People's Queen \u2013 DaenerysIn what was probably one of the few cute, and innocent, moments I can recall in this show, Greyworm, with is having Missandei teach him whatever they call English, as well as Meereen's language. Part of the reason deals with Greyworm infiltrating Meereen and handing weapons to every slave to do battle, of which they do, leading to the first successful slave rebellion after two tries. But, with Daenerys' form of justice does come worry from Ser Barristan who perhaps thinks mercy should be granted upon slavers. This is quickly dismissed though for Daenerys' seeking to be a savior trumps mercy of the oppressors.Still, as Daenerys' looks over the newest acquisition to her kingdom, it is hard not to feel for Greyworm as his crush on Missandei grows. Together they share stories of what life was before slavery, or at least Missandei does. And you can see as they expose their vulnerabilities he wishes to touch her hand, showing that even a warrior trained since childhood is still capable, and susceptible to feelings of love. Unfortunately though, for reasons not revealed, though likely due to him being unsullied, she withdraws her hand before he can even have their fingertips meet.Topic 2: Forget What You Thought \u2013 Jaime & TyrionWhen it comes to Jamie Lannister, it seems the rape incident is supposed to be forgotten and treated as it never happened. In fact, the episode seems to want to pull a 180 degree turn and remind you how capable he is of being a good guy. And even in his scene with Cersei, she seems madder that Jaime is willing to take Tyrion's side than what happened between them in front of Joffrey's corpse. But, according to the director it was consensual and seemingly that is how things are going to roll.But, back to this 180 degree turn. First and foremost, after some training with Bron, Jaime decides to visit Tyrion's cell and trade prisoner stories. Which, due to Tyrion really not being in the mood, leads to some pokes at Jaime's expense when it comes to his relationship with Cersei. The main point of their conversation though is: Did you do it? Of which Tyrion denies and Jaime believes, causing said argument with Cersei.So, being that Jaime is the only one who seems to be in Tyrion's corner, he starts doing what he can from the outside. First, he gives Brienne a suit of armor and his Valerian sword in order to not only find Sansa, but protect her against the will of Cersei; He makes sure Podrick is safe from Tyrion's foes by having him go with Brienne; and all the while he looks at Brienne in such a way which surely was made to have his little rape incident seem like a lapse of judgment. However, being this is Game of Thrones, we must remember that enemies and friends switch sides whenever it is convenient, so it is never good to not take as much note of what allies are doing as foes.Topic 3: The Traitor(s) \u2013 Lord Baelish, Olenna, Rebels of the Night's WatchWhich is said because, friend to the Lannisters, Lord Baelish, is the one who plotted Joffrey's death. The reason why? Well, perhaps part of it dealt with him wanting Sansa, who he looks lustfully at, but the other part also dealt with his new alliance. You see, one woman, who really is only second to Tyrion when it comes to good one liners and mastering a scene, has sort of always hinted at what we saw at Joffrey's wedding. She asked Sansa what she thought of Joffrey, observed the utter lack of command his parents, and grandfather, had over him, and though arranged marriages maybe the norm, she isn't like others who would throw their family to the wolves for a title. No, lady Olenna is smart, hence how she got into her own position. Her sister Viola, you see, was to marry Luthor Tyrell and she a Targaryen, formerly considered something of an honor. But, being that Olenna is very much a feminist with quite political skill and savvy, she made it so Luthor married her, because she put it down so good the man could hardly stand.And this is all noted because Olenna hasn't given up on Margaery, especially since she is to be with Tommen Baratheon, likely. But, she forewarns Margaery that she needs to do, not exactly as she did with Luthor, but definitely make sure her influence comes over Tommen before Cersei. After all, imagine what kind of man Joffrey could have been if it wasn't for his mother?Which leaves us with the rebels of the Night's Watch. Who seemingly will soon have Jon Snow meeting them, with many men of the Night's Watch, as they seek to silence them before Mance Rayder can learn their secrets. This is allowed solely though in hopes Jon will die for Alliser Throne takes note of Jon's rise in popularity and fears having a bastard for a boss. But perhaps the real interesting thing is though is that Locke, Lord Bolton's ally, is amongst those of the Night's Watch and quickly becomes buddies with Jon Snow.Leaving us with one last surprise: The White Walkers. Despite what we have heard, hinting they eat Caster's bastards, it seems Caster's sacrifices are what is allowing them strength. For with a White Walker's touch, one baby turns into one of them, perhaps hinting as to how they grow their army.",

                    "content": "I must say, Meereen looks fantastic both in the opening scene and in the show. Nice to see Missandei and Grey Worm talking, gives some extra flavour to the slavery aspect of Dany's campaign. Nice to get a look into the mind of an Unsullied, which is absent in the books. Good to see Dany's storyline at the start of the episode, rather than always being the big finish. The actual fight, however, comprised of a single melee and was rather unsatisfying and much too short. I wonder if Dany not listening to Barristan is really a wise move, but it serves to again show how powerfully empathetic and determined she is to end slavery.Aside from Pod, there was some good dialogue from the two people who still like Tyrion somewhat. Very good line about how Tyrion has always looked up at Jaime, and the back to forth between the brothers in the jail still shows their bond despite all that has happened. Both Sophie Turner and Sansa have grown so much since the start of the show and I can't wait until we see more of her, out of King's Landing and allowed to finally express her true self. Her poking around Littlefinger's plot already shows how she is beginning to wisen up. I still don't get Aiden Gillen's accent, however. Littlefinger might be revealing too much to Sansa, which could be a bad move for someone so normally cunning. I am disappointed Olenna is leaving, she has been great in every one of her scenes, but it means Margaery steps up as the Tyrell in power. The necklace thing pretty much confirmed what we all thought about the poison. Even these females use their womanly wiles to get what they want, and Margaery is as seductive as ever with Tommen, though judging by where she kissed him, I see she senses that it isn't the way to Tommen's heart,. Maybe that's Ser Pounce. Locke is at the Night's Watch! Surprisingly I didn't see that coming, seeing as he isn't even in the books, but it guess it shows how unforgiving Roose is towards his subjects. I'm not sure what direction they are taking him, I half expect him to betray Jon at some point. The actor for Thorne nails his despicable nature as he is, while Janos Slynt is the same kind. From what Lena Headey has to work with she nails her character, getting more insecure by the moment and drifting away from Jaime. She does seem fine after that questionable sept scene. We didn't exactly get the White Book scene I wanted, but it was good enough. They still seem on course to guide Jaime towards redemption, as seen by the oath he still remembers he swore to Catelyn Stark. Honour is what he still values. Pod's face was hilarious! I loved the Ser/My lady line they took from the books and it's what Pod wanted to do if he couldn't stay with Tyrion. I have grown on Pod immensely. Oathkeeper as the title and name of the sword is very apt and signifies a new chapter beginning.So Sam has told Jon that Bran is still alive! Makes for a nice change, giving Jon a bit of hope. Jon rallying his brothers was a great scene that shows his new maturity and how his is favoured already within the Night's Watch, much more than Alliser Thorne. I always liked LC Mormont and really wanted to see him avenged. I didn't expect such a brutal scene at Craster's Keep with the skull and the rape, but it was a really menacing mood shift when the wives made him go sacrifice the baby to the Walkers. So it looks like Bran has more or less become an adept warg, interesting to see as they always impress with the wolf scenes. So that's where Ghost is, captured by the mutineers. I really wanted to see Hodor floor Rast, it's a testament to how well acted he is that I hate him so much. The Walkers. Wow. That is all makeup and so menacing to see. For years, we have wondered about them and why they need human sacrifices. Were they really as monstrous as we thought? This scene opens up so many new things to ponder, and for once I am genuinely floored and excited as I guess what comes next. Great ending. 8.5/10",

                    "content": "This week's Game of Thrones was a step-up in quality for me from last week, which is surprising because many reviews I have read regarding this episode didn't like it as much and called it \"slow\" or \"meandering.\" I have to disagree with this, simply because the episode laid some great new plot developments with some amazing sequences.The episode started with Daenerys saving the slaves Meereen by starting a revolution against the slave masters. Those who read my reviews know that I am not a Daenerys or Emilia Clarke fan, but these sequences of the episode were arguably the best scenes in the episode. I loved Michelle MacLaren's directing, with the fast cuts of the masters being crucified and the bird's-eye-view shot of the slaves stabbing that one master. The scene concluded with Daenerys looking over her revolution with pride and confidence, the camera zooming out to show her on top of a great pyramid, akin of a great queen looking over the vast empire she has claimed. It was a great scene, filmed magnificently, and it provided the episode with some of its greatest scenes, despite its little plot development.We also had a huge development in Jaime's story. He has given Brienne the titular Oathkeeper, and makes her promise to find and protect Sansa. It's a great plot development (but knowing this show, it'll be three seasons before Brienne actually makes it to Sansa). As great as the plot was, it provided some questionable motives regarding Jaime. After last week's internet uproar about Jaime's \"rape\" of Cersei, it was weird to see him resort back to his character progression, going against the Lannisters and helping out Tyrion and sending Brienne to rescue a Stark. I love Jaime's development and the path his character is progressing in, but it was conflicting to see him so different than he was depicted last week.We also received the answer to who killed Joffrey! I admittedly spoiled this for myself, reading the novel synopsis on Wikipedia, but it was surprising and exciting for first-time viewers to have it revealed that both Littlefinger and Olenna were behind Joffrey's death. It's great to see these two characters behind it, as I've always loved Littlefinger and his duplicitous nature.The last huge plot development was Bran's. I've never liked Bran, and I've hated his story since the end of Season 2 when he rode away from the burnt Winterfell. His story has been very plodding, meandering, and arguably pointless, but it was exciting to see his story take an exciting and dramatic turn by being captured at Craster's Keep. It's even more exciting to know that Jon is on his way, so it's possible that he meets Bran again, but knowing this show, that won't happen. I'm excited to see where this story at Craster's Keep goes, but one thing is for sure: it's not going to end in peace. The people at Craster's Keep are despicable people, raping women to death and sacrificing babies to the White Walkers, and I'll be glad to see them get their comeuppance at the hands of Snow.And that led to this week's haunting and exciting ending with the White Walker. It was intense seeing him ride away with the baby, as we didn't know where he was going and what he was going to do. I think I figured it out when he lifted him up and went to touch his forehead, and my prediction was confirmed when the baby's eyes turned blue, revealing how White Walker's are made and the growing Walker army that is enlarging, one baby at a time. It was an exciting and haunting ending to a similarly exciting and very plot-heavy episode that progressed the story in new and exciting ways.+ Great new plot progressions+ Exciting sequences \u2013 Daenerys and the White Walker+ Great cinematography and editingSome weird and conflicting character work with JaimeOverall: A",

Jaime gives her the sword , the Armour and also Podrick Payne the loyal squire of Tyrion Lannister to find Sansa Stark and protect her. Thus their journey begins. Wish she knew that the stark girl is in a ship on her way to the Vale. Oh well , more the mystery , more the fun.Furthermore on castle black we saw some new recruits joining the watch. Wait, is that Locke?.. Yes! The man who made the king slayer cripple . A trusted banner man of Roose Bolton on the wall? Is he there to kill Ned stark's bastard? Let's wait and find out . So Jon snow is ready to march towards Craster's keep to capture or kill the brothers who broke the vow and murdered lord commander. Those are some nasty people . And Bran and company gets caught by the nasty people , furthermore he reveals himself as Brandon Stark of Winterfell. Hurry up Jon snow you better reach the keep before they start playing with their prize.This show just never ceases to amaze it's viewers. Remember the babies that white walkers took. Well we finally got to see what happens to them. In my opinion , making a show after the books has it's perks. We can tight up some lose ends. Not that I'm saying there are, but you can improve some things from here and there. The babies are taken away into the north and they are turned , \"TURNED INTO WHITE WALKERS?\" OMG!! Who knew that? Well, hats off to the amazing producers on the show . Every other episode is another master piece. Well done guys, WELL DONE",

We have several story lines and we all have our interests and favorite characters, but each episode only gives us so much, if they are featured at all. If you watch an episode now and think back you will realize that after 4 episodes so far ( and almost reaching half of this season) the story hasn't moved much nor have we seen any serious developments apart from the death of Joffrey.The story now moves at low speed leaving a lot of viewers with a hunger. A huge story like this with so many characters should feature episodes of at least 90 minutes each. This would pick up the pace and add some depth to the story itself and of course the characters.",

                    "content": "*This review contains spoilers for this episode*Game of Thrones continues an excellent season with many interesting pairings and matches in this episode. A talk on a ship, a walk in a park and much is revealed about the plotting behind the scenes reminding us what a deadly viper pit King's Landing is! Jaime and Bronn, Jaime and Tyrion, Jaime and Cersei, Jaime and Brienne. All these scenes were excellent and did not tip the hat either this way or that for Jaime. GoT excels at this ambiguity/uncertainty more than many lesser shows - this character has done many bad things: trying to kill a kid, bashing his relative's head in with a rock to make an escape, forcing himself on his sister - but also many good things. While there was much outcry last week that he was now an unredeemable rapist, the truth is a little blurrier - as always intended, each viewer will have to balance his good deeds and bad deeds and decide for themselves - no trite generalities allowed. Another such ambiguity introduced in this episode is the appearance of Locke at the wall - we know Bolton sent him yet he seems genuinely impressed with Jon Snow (who btw this season has jumped into awesome gear!) - so when Locke volunteers we wonder if he does it to carry out nefarious deeds or does he do it because he admires Snow? This is what makes GoT stand out - the characters evolve and little is black and white - much is uncertain. Margery's bedside talk with Tommen also stood out in this way - it was both sweet and a little bit creepy due to the age difference at the same time. Regardless it let us see aspects of both the characters and I have to say I really like Tommen so far - another young casting coup for GoT I predict!I love the pairing of Brienne and Podrick - hope we see some of their adventures! Bran's story also got a whole lot more interesting suddenly and the glimpse of life in the mutineer camp was also revealing with their leader fleshed out in this episode.Finally the end scene was breathtaking and intriguing, leaving you wanting to see more of the whitewalker's realm. Congratulations GoT, you've got at least 10 scenes I am aching to see the followup to!",

Not to mention the acting was pretty bad throughout these scenes.I understand that changes have to be made due to lack of time, to further the story, etc., and up till now I had no qualms with any of the changes, but this one was so bad, it really ruined the episode for me.I love this series, but this is the first time I did not enjoy an episode.

It must be very important for later storyline and story outcome (finale) otherwise they wouldn't mention it; I surely like the idea of white walkers and their possible role in story outcome. Also I can't understand all the bad comments that I read in IMDb. If book fans (and therefore show fans!!!) expect to see strictly the same story they already read, why they after all watch show, they already know everything? All in this episode is perfectly well executed and written. Some of the alterations that are even possible in the book are very well written and presented. There is nothing bad in this episode it is even one of the best of whole series; Game of Thrones episodes become better and better as the story progress! 11/10",

The baby sacrifice has been going on for years, adding this scene only explains what happens to the babies. There is no and will not be a POV on a white walker, these guys don't speak so that would be an empty character, what they showed us is something that will never occur in the books since it is impossible to tell. It is ridiculous to think of this scene as a spoiler! Soon people won't even read the books or watch the series because they don't want to spoil themselves. Ridiculous. I read all the books, and I really enjoyed this episode so much I was clapping when it finished.They did add some changes, like the Bran scene at craster's, but that is no more than expected. The main events always occur, the characters only get there in a slightly different way. Except Jon's plan to attack the deserters at Crasters, that's entirely new but is not bad because it is new. It's one of those reasons to keep watching the series even if you read the books. If you expect the series to be a copy of the books you're gonna have a bad time.So after all, this was and is one of the best episodes so far in GoT. 9,5/10",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"First of His Name\" is another great episode for Season 4, which has been consistently strong with the incredible \"The Lion and the Rose\" (a 'Game of Thrones' highlight) coming off best. Am aware of the dislike for the previous 'Game of Thrones' episode \"Oathkeeper\", mainly for the significant deviations from the source material, personally don't share it. My only real complaint for \"First of His Name\" is the really corny Jon and Karl fight scene, which comes off more unintentionally silly than tense. What \"First of His Name\" does brilliantly though is looking back on past events and providing the answers that were very much needed for some time. Yet it also still sets us up too for future events in succeeding episodes. It is not a fast-paced episode and is exposition-heavy, but it was an episode with so much content that it did not need a fast pace and needed the time for the events to unfold. The exposition too is interesting, providing answers to long-probing questions and moving things forward and preparing one for what is to follow.All the cast are superb yet again, especially Aidan Gillen's Littlefinger and Lena Headey as Cersei (am really liking that Cersei has been more interesting this season than before in previous seasons). The writing for Littlefinger and the female roles here (especially for Cersei and Sansa) is pretty exceptional.Visually, \"First of His Name\" looks amazing. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"First of His Name\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Overall, great episode yet again. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Any episode with the Hound in it has a lot of goodwill coming from me too, and Podrick has transformed into a likeable character by this stage. The Sansa plotline is also more interesting than it has been for a season or two. Great stuff!",

The poor Sansa certainly has a jinx and can only get in trouble. Another surprise is that the Lannisters are completely broken. Locke has had what he deserved.

As the ceremony draws to a close Cersei goes to Margaery Tyrell and suggests that she marry Tommen; she acts as though the idea hadn't crossed her mind. Of course the reason the Lannisters want such a union is because the kingdom is broke; with no prospect of paying its debts without the Tyrells. Elsewhere Sansa and Lord Baelish reach The Eyrie; the home of Sansa's aunt Lysa Arryn and her son Robin. Here Sansa learns that she will be expected to marry Robin after Tyrion's expected execution\u0085 possibly a worse prospect than Joffrey had been! In Meereen Daenerys learns two things; she now has a navy that could take her back to King's Landing with a force that might be large enough to take the Iron Throne and that the cities of Yunkai and Astapor, which she had thought liberated, are back in the hands of tyrants\u0085 this leads her to decide that for the time being her priorities do not lie in Westeros. North of the wall the Night's Watch reach Craster's Keep and deal with the mutineers; however Jon and Bran are not reunited.This is another fine episode which serves to advance the plot as well as providing some impressive action. One can't help feeling sorry for Sansa as her situation never seems to improve; Sophie Turner does a fine job in the role, capturing her character's vulnerability. The events at the Eyrie also show us that Lord Baelish and Lysa Arryn have been scheming for a long time; Aidan Gillen and Kate Dickie are on top form. The scenes in King's Landing serve to remind us of the Kingdom's finances as well as the need to form alliances with people you don't trust. Not much happens with Daenerys but we do see that she is determined to protect those she has liberated rather than leaving for Westeros at the first opportunity. The scenes at Crastor's Keep provide the episode's action as well as some disturbing moments; notably as Karl Tanner threatens to rape Meera Reed\u0085 this leads nicely to the satisfaction when he gets his comeuppance after her brother had told him of a vision of seeing him killed. The attack on the keep was exciting and more than a little gory. There was some levity in the episode as we see Brienne and Podrick riding along as he demonstrates his inability to ride or even cook a rabbit; he does however manage to impress her when she learns how he saved Tyrion during the Battle of Blackwater Bay. The scenes between Arya and The Hound were enjoyable even if they were mainly there to remind us that they were still trudging through the countryside.",

                    "content": "I'm not fully sure, due to my memory, whether past season of Game of Thrones were more exciting, or if just the exciting moments are all I remember, hence why I come back year after year. Either way, arguably there is one big moment in each season, and with it seeming like Joffrey's death maybe this season's big moment, I must admit it is leading this show to have a similar issue to what The Sopranos had. Said issue being that a show known for violence and sex becomes boring once those two features are put on the back burner. Luckily though, with an appearance from Daenerys and Jon's battle with the Night's Watch rebels, there are a handful of things to keep you interested.Topic 1: King's Landing \u2013 Cersei, Margaery, and Oberyn.With Tommen's crowning comes the need for politics to be observed. Seemingly, at least for now, Cersei decides to be friendly toward Margaery, who seems to have charmed Tommen and now seeks to befriend Cersei in the process. But, even while they are friendly, this maybe because Cersei seemingly feels less and less powerful every day. She gives into her eventual marriage to Loras, and has it planned post- Tommen's, and as she speaks with Oberyn later in the episode, she admits to being as powerless as him. She is one of the fiercest women, whose blood line is of one of the fiercest houses, and yet she couldn't save her son. Just as Oberyn, a world renowned warrior, couldn't save his dear sister.And as we watch Cersei, we see her in a rare moment of softness. For while she still wants Tyrion's head, her grief softens her usually armored exterior. If just because we see her vulnerability, her as a mother, and not just the strength of a queen.Topic 2: Odd Friendships \u2013 Brienne & AryaAs Brienne ventures with Podrick to get Sansa, a new odd friendship blossoms on the show. For with Brienne not having much interest in a squire, and Podrick having no squire skills, Podrick is, at best, but a companion at this point. But with hearing Podrick killed a king's guard, this allows Brienne to slightly see her squire as something worth taking an interest in. In fact, I'd argue she would likely train him to be something more than Tyrion's butler/ messenger boy.But while Brienne and Podrick's relationship seems off to a good start, The Hound and Arya's is as rocky as we usually see it. First, Arya mentions she seeks to kill The Hound, amongst many others, and even stabs him with Needle. But, even with all this happening, their odd understanding is maintained. Though if Arya ever gets strong enough, I'm sure she would murder The Hound in a heartbeat.Topic 3: Liberation \u2013 Daenerys, Sansa, Bran & JonThus leaving us with the more interesting part of the episode, of which we get to see Daenerys, Sansa, and the Stark brothers almost reunited. Starting with Daenerys, it seems all the cities she has liberated are basically being taken back over, and the timing couldn't be worse. She has the basic needs to try to take King's Landing, but considering the fact she can't even liberate slaves, and keep them free, it makes for a hard argument to really serve and respect her. So, upon realizing that she has much work to do at Yunkai and Astapor, she decides to retake the cities before setting her sights on King's Landing.Which leaves us with the Stark children. Sansa, finally, is with one of her own, but as usual with her life, nothing good is without issue. For one, Lord Baelish is still a bit of a creeper, and what makes things worse is her aunt Lysa is jealous of her. For, you see, she was also very jealous of her sister and with Lord Baelish so invested in her, she sees her as competition. And considering she killed her own husband for Lord Baelish, you can see that Lysa is a rather fragile woman who may have her son, but she needs a man. This is especially punctuated by how loudly she screams when having sex with Lord Baelish and wanting to get married pronto. The bad part about this all for Sansa is, outside of her aunt's jealousy, is that also, after Tyrion dies, she expects Sansa to marry her son Robin, who is her cousin.Then, lastly, there is Bran and Jon. Two brothers who almost nearly meet, but end up missing one another. For, during the siege on the Night's Watch rebels, Locke tries to make sure the brothers don't meet by first telling Jon to stay clear of the area Bran is in, then trying to kidnap him to, assumingly, take to Lord Bolton. However, it seems it is not Bran's time to die. So, to fight back against Locke, Bran possesses Hodor and has him snap Locke's neck. Something which seemingly Hodor isn't happy about for he looks at his hands in shock before doing as Bran request, which is free Jojen and Meera.And then, with Jon but a few feet away, fighting against the rebels, Bran is given an ultimatum by Jojen. Either seek out the three eyed raven, or likely be stuck at Castle Black. An ultimatum which forces Bran to seek out the three eyed raven for being coddled doesn't seem like an option. As for Jon, he squashed the rebels, gets back his wolf, and all this will likely lead to Alliser Throne to lose his mind.",

                    "content": "He's only had a few scenes but Tommen already impresses me more than his older brother, which isn't saying much regardless. I think we all get the impression he is still just a pawn in the game of thrones, evident by the struggle over him between Cersei and Margaery. I'm glad they have brought Cersei down a level, in some ways she is most human as a mother. I heard Dany likes ships. Her delivery I find has been a bit lacking, like she only knows how to vocalise her emotions in epic speeches of retribution against slavers. You can already see her struggles as the cities she has liberated have already begun to start revolting. It will be interesting to see how she handles things not going her way for the first time. Looks like she is determined to find her power and knowledge as a ruler first. Littlefinger is as devious as ever and charms even the most despicable paring of Lysa Arryn and his son Robin. Alayne's disguise doesn't seem to be anything more than a hood however, you can even see her trademark red hair. Sansa seems to be way more mature and understanding now, taking everything into stride so quickly. Lysa seems to be hovering between insanity one moment and normal another. It was almost a bit gross to see them making out so hungrily, and her screams afterwards. What was even bigger was the revelation of LF as the instigator of Jon Arryn's death. The talk with Lysa and Sansa was very well acted and even gave us a little backstory about Cat and LF's relationship. It might be why he wants to protect Sansa so much.Opposite of that are the Lannisters who are revealed to have run out of gold. It makes for a great pre-introduction to the might of the Iron Bank who have funded families and armies for years. Tywin still commands so much power nevertheless, and his value of his family over his own sons is very telling, not even willing to compromise his honour as a trail judge. I respect him much more for it. An interesting thing about Arya's list is that the Hound, her traveling companion, is now off that list. At least that was what happened in the books, but it seems the show Arya is much more aligned to revenge. They grow on each other but still retain that mutual hate. In some ways they both need each other, as a hostage and as a way of getting to safety. So Arya can't just slit his throat in his sleep quite yet. I miss Syrio, but as both Syrio and the Dothraki know, armour is a vital part of warfare. Pod has become one of my favourite characters, his own brand of charm and awkwardness rivals even that of Brienne's. It will be interesting to see their dynamic relationship and how they will even begin to look for Sansa. Getting to the wall from KL is a long journey. If Pod ever reunites with Tyrion, it will be a great scene as the person who saved his life. I saw a bit of respect for Pod in Brienne's eyes as he told the story. I really like what they did with Cersei and Oberyn, it's fair to say that the Red Viper has become one of the fan favourites. They yet again provide some backstory to Oberyn's intentions here as well as the Dorne alliance due to Myrcella. There is an interesting parallel here that both of them want revenge for a lost family member, but have different ways of getting it.I'm sure we still remember Locke as the hunter who has been assigned to finish off Bran and Rickon. I wonder how Jon will react to this revelation.A great little bit of CGI makes me think that they will all get to safety and find the three eyed crow. That didn't stop me getting worried for Meera all chained up. The fight scene was a bit dark and murky and before we knew it, Bran had been shanked in the stomach! Therefore it was very satisfying to see Hodor manhandle Locke like that. I hope he's dead. It was so agonising to not see Bran and Jon reunited, but it was to be expected. The Night's Watch should really invest in some decent armour and shields, judging by the beatdown Karl gave Jon. It was fitting his cruel treatment of the wives was his end. 8/10",

                    "content": "Thus far, Game of Thrones' fourth season has been sublime. Dropping the traditional slow burn of Game of Thrones' usual opening episodes, we've had shocking deaths, huge action sequences and a plethora of brilliantly memorable conversations. Which is why it's such a shame that First of His Name drops the ball a little bit. I have no doubts things will pick up again next week, but this episode suffered from, simply, a lack of anything interesting. The Jon Arryn reveal was well handled (and nice to finally be solved) and the final moments were refreshingly action packed, but everything in between felt tuned down. Although, it was nice to see Cersei represented in a positive light for once. She's certainly one of the more interesting characters of the show, and it was good to see her portrayed as human again. She has an endless, undeniable love for her children. This has always been my favourite quality in Cersei.But, unfortunately, all was not well. While it was still a notch above most other TV dramas, nothing was really advanced her. Dany still just moped about for a while, Arya and the Hound just argued again, Brienne scowled at Podrick and Sansa looked sad. This is pretty much what we've seen in every episode this season. It's time to pick things up again guys. Also, Jon's final victory over Karl was not something I expect from Game of Thrones. Could it have been anymore clich\u00e9? Sp,e random girl we've barely seen randomly appears and gives Jon the upper hand. Really? This is something I expect from the likes of The Following, certainly not Game of Thrones. Finally, is it me, or is Game of Thrones not as good now as it once was in terms of keeping us informed with every character? I mean, where is Varys while all this is going on? Are we ever going to see Theon again? Does Stannis still care about the Iron Throne? Midway through the season and Theon has piped up once. Game of Thrones has always been commendable for its strong hold on the characters, I really don't want them to lose their grasp on that now. Whilst tonight's episode was pretty sub-par, it still offered strong dialogue and a few interesting developments. Just pick up the pace again in the next episode please.",

I think that they both have there value, but I'm thrilled that the show runners handle some sub-character way better than the book does. Margary Tyrell, for example, is a much richer character in the show than she is in the books. Overall it was a nice episode with several great sequences, of course the great reveal of Littlefinger, the growing tension between Margary and Cercei and the relationship between the Hound and Arya Stark. The only thing that I actually did not like at all was the pointless Night's Watch / Locke storyline. That was so incredibly stupid and ultimately disappointing. Game of thrones can do much better than that.I liked the Craster's keep plot in the previous episode, although it wasn't in the book. It was exciting and I was curious where the writers would take this. Bran being captured and Locke undercover in the Night's Watch were nice additions and I was really looking forward to how this was going to resolve itself. Unfortunately the pay off is a bit anti-climactic and stupid. The first dumb thing happens when Locke finds Bran, although he couldn't have known if Bran was actually there in the first place. Afterward he tells Jon to stay away from the cabin where Bran is being held because there could be dogs locked up inside. These dogs could warn the enemies and would ruin their surprise attack. But the attack can't be called a surprise attack because they attack screaming, alarming their enemies (including the fictional dogs) in the process. So what's the point of staying away from the cabin? Anyway, Locke captures Bran unseen instead of killing him. That raises another question: Why didn't he just kill him and resolve Roose Bolton's problem altogether? How did he hope to escape with Bran and return to the Dreadfort unseen by the Night's Watch? (should he not need to pass trough the wall to get south of the wall?) Locke runs off with Bran only to get himself killed by Hodor. This was an unceremonious way to kill off his character. (which, in this season, almost didn't resemble any of his sadistic characteristic traits established from the previous season) It was like the writers needed him gone as soon as possible because the show is too stuffed with many characters already so there wouldn't be room for the ones they made up in the TV show. It also felt a bit repetitive to have Bran almost run into Jon Snow AGAIN only to leave him AGAIN. It worked the previous time in the third season, but now it felt forced and unnecessary to me. The plot went nowhere and the characters didn't advance anything of the overall plot.The character of Karl Tanner was a nice addition and he was interesting. His final fight with Jon Snow, unfortunately, was not all that exciting not to mention rather corny. Having him ignore Jon when the random woman attacks him was incredibly stupid for example.It was disappointing that the writers handled this plot so poorly. (especially with all the build up for, in the end, such a useless character as Locke) Otherwise it was a great episode, but due to the reasons I pointed out above, I was a bit underwhelmed.",

                    "content": "Lots of answers in one episode. Lots of emotional changes inside the characters. In my point of view I saw:*Arya to try to split from the hound. Yet not strong enough, yet full of wrath. However the storyline keeps frozen, like in the books and it should be like that.*Littlefinger / Sansa / Lysa: Lysa seems to me as one of the most distasteful characters (the actress is bringing her up in a fantastic way) in the world of Westeros. Her character made her kill her former husband. Her son Robin is a psychopath, if you look what he did with his gift. The scene with Sansa lying in her bed and hearing Lysa's love screams, which is absolutely identical to the storyline in the books, shows Sansa's new desperation. For Sansa it seems to have entered a new hell where absolutely no one can be trusted, if you see the conversation with Lysa and Sansa afterward. It seems to me that the directors of GoT shortened this story of the books to a reasonable degree. This short plot also shows that Sansa's character is about to change. *Tommen as new king, who looks like a victim for the future as he will be \"controlled\" by all forces surrounding him.*Margaery Tyrell the queen of many, who allies in a pact with vicious Cercei.*Dany sticking to \"rule\" instead of conquest - sadly also her most exciting journey now ended. Actually I was sad that the takeover of Meereen was just presented in little 10 minutes. It was ~far~ more exciting in the books. *Brienne and Pod on their start to travel - and yes it will be a ~long~ one and yes unfortunately I didn't enjoy their plot of loyalty, faith and honor in the books.* The development in the north - Jon Snow attacking. Nothing else as expected.As mentioned in earlier reviews I see this episode as turning point of GoT. It will be questionable whether the future plot of the books with the main characters of the future (like Brienne, Sam, Bran, Lysa, the Boltons etc.) can be presented in the fashion they did it with season 1 - 4.5.My point here is that the main actors of seasons 1 - 4.5 key characters which were Eddard Stark, Cat Stark, Rob Stark, Joffrey Baratheon, Khal Drogo, Tywin Lannister, Shae, Varys, Robert Baratheon, the Greyjoys and even Ranley Baratheon did such a great performance that the new \"setup\" will have a very very hard time to match ~their~ performance. With the current actors I don't expect it as possible. I see this like a theater where the actors are changing, yet still continue to play the same story. It will be tough for the directors to get the future of the \"Song of Ice and Fire\" as attractive as its past. To be fair the actors of Sam, Brienne, Lysa, Ramsey, Pod might not have the \"attraction\" of the crew before. However I will keep watching and I hope for the best after Tyrion's trail.Yet again the past got covered up, while the future just started.For me still this episode deserves a top star rating!",

First Renly then Joffrey I don't wanna see poor Tommen get stabbed by a shadow that looks like Stannis or get poisoned at his own wedding. Yeah, so Tommen of the house Baratheon (Lannister) first of his name sits the Iron Throne as the king of seven kingdoms and protector of the realm. Yeah \" First of his name \" as the episode's title suggests.Daenerys likes ships , of course she does , she can't expect to swim all the way across the narrow sea or fly on her dragons which by the way according to Ser Jorah (Friend zoned) Mormont can't be tamed. Well there goes her hopes. Thank you Ser Mormont. Also there's a revolt started in the slaver cities , Astapor and Yunkai , well let's see what will she do about that. Guess she's gonna *puts on shades* RULE \"yeaaaaaaaaah\"Sansa and Peeta reach the Eyrie . Oh she musn't tell anyone who she is. Only Little finger and his wife Lysa Arryn and her son Robin knows about the Stark girl. Yeah I said \"WIFE\" . Well here's something new Jon Arryn wasn't killed by the Lannisters after all. What were those drops? Of course it can only be poison , what else? So Peter gave the drops to Lysa to poison the hand of the king , her husband??? . This changes everything . All the starks would be alive now and living happily in Winterfell , none of this would have started. Well to be honest it started when Robert killed the last dragon Rheagar on the trident , but that's all in the past now . So is lady stark ,whom Peter loved and just due to that love this cold hearted guy saved her daughter. So Sansa's aunt and Peter get married right on the spot. She's a little crazy from above having her doubts about Sansa , wondering that Sansa will take him away from her. After all she is the daughter of the woman Baelish wanted.Arya should get an armour and a long sword if she really wants to kill someone. That's what The Hound says who by the way is also on Arya's precious hit list.The adventures of Brienne and Podrick. That could be a real good short novel or an actual novel, depending on when does she find Sansa. But sadly she is on her way to The Wall . *sigh* someone please tell Lady Tarth that the girl isn't on the wall protected by her half brother Jon Snow, who by the way also isn't.Jon and his brothers in black move out to Craster's keep to kill or capture the men of the night's watch that have taken the place and have been using every thing that they can get their hands upon. Sadly , the loyal and trusted Bannerman of Bolton is there for some other business. The guy finds Brandon Stark but Hodor finds him first. That strength tho. HODOR!!!! . So Jon and his men killed all the lot. Bran also had a chance to meet his brother, and he also needs to reach the raven beyond the wall. You know what they say , Ravens before crows. Ah well that was so lame of me . So yeah , The keep is burned along with the men that held it as the flames turned to black smoke and met with the wind that blows heavily in the land beyond the wall.",

                    "content": "I know people are referring to this episode in a \"midseason finale\" kind of way, which is totally wrong considering the fact that each season of Thrones is hyper serialized and doesn't need a midseason finale hook to bring viewers back for the last half. With that being said though, this episode was most definitely the turning point for the show.Game of Thrones may very well be on its back half of the show now, with the producers saying they want 7 (and possibly 8) seasons total. FoHN seemed to wrap up many loose ends from the previous 3 and a half seasons, and pave a much different road for the next 3 and a half. We found out that Lysa Arryn was the one that murdered her husband (with help from Littlefinger), which was an answer we've been waiting for since the first episode. We learned that Cersei recognized Joffrey as a monster, but chose to love and support his decisions anyways. We learned that Bran has understood his ultimate destiny is to travel beyond the wall and leave his family behind. And we learned that Dany has understood slow and steady wins the race.In a lot of ways, FoHN was about leaving the past behind, and choosing to look forward on what's head. Lysa moving forward with Littlefinger. Cersei moving forward with Tommen at the throne (and letting Margarey into her life). Bran moving forward away from whatever family he has left. Dany giving up the enticing Iron Throne to move forward and pay back her debts. Everyone is moving forward, everyone has begun to heal from what's happened.The threats are real, as they've always been, but from here on it the threats are much different in magnitude and embodiment. The \"enemy\" from the start of season 4 has now been drastically shifted and the dynamic between many characters have fluctuated and landed on a settling point.I don't expect things to remain the same for very long, they never do on GoT, but what has happened is at least a shift in the show's formula and underlying struggle. No longer is it the war against the Lannister's and King's Landing (although for some it is, *ahem* Stannis) but more about the war against the truths we choose to ignore.Are the White Walkers to lay siege against Westeros? Will Mance Rayder conquer his lands? Is Dany truly the most suitable for the Iron Throne? What does Bran hope to seek from the three eyed raven? Does Jon's destiny lie with being the natural born leader of the war against evil above the wall? Where will Littlefinger stop, if ever? These are the questions pegging GoT from here on out.",

                    "content": "*THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS*'First of His Name' is another fantastic installment of Game of Thrones, now marking the midpoint of this excellent series. This episode finally gives us some answers, action, and scenes with sharply written dialogue from some of our favorite odd couples. The show once again manages to make a strong episode even lacking some of the best cast members (eg. Tyrion,Jaime). We pick up on Tommen's coronation which sees Tywin consolidate his power over the realm, Cersei and Margaery realize that they have their Queenly ambitions in common. We see a more relatable side to Cersei this week, as her excellently scripted conversations with Oberyn and Margaery reveal a loving mother \"just looking out for her children\" side to her, a far more pleasant side to the Queen of Madness that we are used to, even though she does appear to admit her uncertainty of Tyrion's guilt, but want him gone anyway. Some hatreds die hard. The scenes with Arya and the Hound provide sharp quotable dialogue as always, still an enjoyable pairing to watch, but at this point it would be welcome to see their story advance, without wanting to slip into Lord of the rings style scenes of endless walking. Some less notable appearances this week go to Danaerys and Brienne. Brienne's scene gives us a little bit of character development for Pod, an always likable character, but not much more. Danaerys' scene this week just seems like stalling her storyline so that they can keep her in Essos until she is needed in Westeros, but the trailer for episode 6 appears to suggest that her storyline may be advancing quicker than we think (we shall have to wait and see).It was very much appreciated this week to get some uninterrupted action, in a fantastic scene beyond the wall. We see the problem of Locke (sent by Roose to capture/kill Bran Stark) solved, by none other than Hodor, and a brilliant fight scene between the Night's Watch and its deserters, finally meaning that we can advance the Wall storyline to the Wildling threat once again. The fight between Jon and Karl starts off impressive and we fear for Jon's life given the rate Game of Thrones has for executing characters. But herein lies my only problem with the episode (why I gave it 9 stars), because Jon is saved by the \"last second\" clich\u00e9. Literally, the threat from Karl was too good, so one of Kraster's wives had to kill Karl in the very last second to save Jon Snow. Game of Thrones has always been unique in its realistic yet random killing off of main characters where nothing is expected. The last minute save kind of ruins this, and I hope they don't do it again. I'm not saying I wanted Jon to die, just to survive in a different way.The best moments of the episode for me came in the Eyrie scenes with Littlefinger, Sansa, Lysa and Robin. We got answers finally! Who killed Jon Arryn? Lysa Arryn, she admits to Littlefinger, at the command of Littlefinger himself. This means that Littlefinger has been playing his own game and that most of the events at the beginning of the story, and perhaps many of them after it, have been his plan all along. Where does his plan end? What does he want? One answer only leads to more questions, and we will have to wait to find out. Overall fantastic episode, with one clich\u00e9d flaw. But still entirely enjoyable with strong acting and dialogue as always.9.5/10",

                    "content": "This season as a whole has been amazing- the storyline has been much more compact, focusing on only a few plot lines each week; as a result, a lot more happens per episode in terms of characterization as well as plot development than what used to happen in the previous seasons. While this season has already given us classics like The Lion and the Rose and Oathkeeper, I feel that this episode one just knocked it out of the park. Every single sequence this episode was extremely well thought out, but I'm going to focus on the three most important things in this episode:Cersei- at first, I was extremely confused by how she was acting, as the things she was saying were extremely considerate of others, not sounding like Cersei at all. I saw a lot of outrage about this on Westeros.org. However, upon rewatch, I quickly realized that she was manipulating the judges to make so as to gain support at the trial. This was amazingly subtle and very well thought out by D&D. Side note: Oberyn Martell is easily turning out to be one of the most memorable characters of the show. Eyrie- everything that went on at the Eyrie was amazing. Aidan Gillen was actually really good this time around, and Kate Dicke was great as Lysa Arryn (glad to have her back). The imagery is truly spectacular. Of course, the highlight of these scenes was Sophie Turner- Sansa has become an amazing character this season, and Sophie Turner has completely aced every scene she's been in. The crying scene was particularly memorable. Finally, Craster's Keep- while some might have viewed this as filler, I found this sequence to be amongst the greatest sequences the show has ever done. Every character, from Bran to Jon to Jojen (MVP of this episode, easily) had really good moments. Sure, it wasn't required for plot advancement. But seriously, seeing how much every other scene in every episode does that, I loved the fact that we got a great action sequence instead this time. Plus, Jojen's vision has become my favourite scene from the show's entire run.So, my ranking of the episodes so far this season:1. First of His Name 2. The Lion and the Rose 3. Oathkeeper 4. Breaker of Chains 5. Two Swords",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Laws of Gods and Men\" is a season high of the fourth season (a great one, am aware that some do dislike \"Oathkeeper\" for its treatment of the source material, personally don't share that dislike though the episode is still not a favourite of mine), tied with \"The Lion and the Rose\". Also one of the magnum opuses of all 'Game of Thrones' episodes, along with \"Baelor\", \"Blackwater\" and \"The Rains of Castamere\" as far as previous episodes of 'Game of Thrones' go.While the whole episode and its various storylines is thoroughly absorbing, with the right amount of tension and emotional impact (like with the whole stuff with Yara), it's Tyrion's trial that has been the most talked about scene for good reason. Not just one of Season 4's best scenes, Tyrion's speech being absolutely earth-shattering in its power and one is with him every step of the way, but one of the best in 'Game of Thrones' history from personal opinion. All the performances are uniformly excellent, but it's the phenomenal powerhouse that is Peter Dinklage is the one who burns into the memory and in a different league to everybody and anything else. While he was nominated for an Emmy for his performance, he should have won it. Visually, \"The Laws of Gods and Men\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Laws of Gods and Men\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Concluding, magnificent episode and a season and show high-point. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Only the material with Daenerys feels like filler here and it's great to see Ser Davos doing what he does best as a negotiator and hand. Inevitably the big emphasis is on Tyrion's trial which fills up the second half of the episode and Peter Dinklage shines in what is his single best moment on the show; a phenomenal performance. It's a real pity that Tyrion became a lesser character after this season.",

In Meereen people are making their requests to their new queen, Daenerys, one is upset that her dragons have killed his goats another wants to be allowed to bury his father; a man she had crucified. Back in Westeros Yara Greyjoy leads a raid against the Dreadfort with the intention of rescuing her brother Theon; she finds a broken man who doesn't want to leave; he has no idea who he once was. Back in the capital it is time for Tyrion's trial; it quickly becomes apparent that all the witnesses are determined to see him found guilty; none more so than Shae. Jaime pleas with his father to spare Tyrion's life and he accepts, with conditions, however Tyrion's final act may render that deal irrelevant.This episode starts well; we have frequently heard of the Iron Bank of Braavos so it was good to finally see it; Mark Gatiss makes a welcome guest appearance as Tycho Nestoris, the man who decides whether they get any gold. The scenes involving Daenerys were interesting enough as they show her as a queen getting involved in the running of the city rather than as the conqueror we often see her as. The episodes action was provided by Yara's raid on the Dreadfort; this was pretty exciting as well as showing just how broken Theon is; Gemma Whelan did a fine job as Yara making her believable as a warrior more than capable of leading men into battle.The part of the episode that is most impressive is the final section where we see Tyrion's trial; Peter Dinklage is outstanding as Tyrion when he gives his impassioned final speech. The rest of the cast impress too; I particularly liked Conleth Hill's performance as Lord Varys, the only witness who appeared sympathetic to Tyrion and Pedro Pascal who plays Oberyn Martell. As this scene, and episode, ended I was left keen to see what will happen to Tyrion; can't wait to watch the next episode.",

                    "content": "I find it unfortunate, as a fan, that when the show opts to develop characters, further story lines, and actually focus on something besides sex and violence, I get a tad bored of the show. And though it probably speaks much more about me than anything else, I think the fact of the matter is, while the characters are all equally interesting, I would argue the majority of the actors and actresses give only an adequate performance. While Peter Dinklage, as well as Lena Headey, seem to actually be doing more than reciting lines with a taste of feeling, but trying to make their performances almost Shakespearean. Hence why whenever there is a news article on the show, usually one or both are named.Topic 1: A Chance at Retribution \u2013 Theon (Reek) & DaenerysWith Ramsay thoroughly embarrassing those of the Iron Isles, Asha seems to vow to rebuild the name of the Greyjoys by getting Theon back. Problem is, whatever psychological torture Ramsay has caused him, it seems to have been implanted so deep that the sight of his sister doesn't bring relief, but fear. This man, castrated by Ramsay, decides to forego the one opportunity he had to escape, the one opportunity where all these sacrifices he has made could actually be worth something, and alas, stay loyal to his torturer.This is good for Ramsay though, for with Asha showing her face, and doing battle with Ramsay, he now feels that it is the time to impress father. So, using Theon as a sort of Trojan Horse, he seemingly wants to head to the Iron Isles and maybe do battle there, making his father Lord Bolton proud, and maybe ascending a bit higher than simply being his bastard.Meanwhile, across the waters, Daenerys continues to sit as Queen in Meereen and seemingly is about to eat the words of Ser Barriston by not granting mercy. If just because the children of the slave masters live, and though one, Hizdar zo Lovaq, seems to respect her, with his father's death you can see that he can easily become an enemy within the city. But, in recognition of Lovaq's father being an exception, for he was against slavery and is credited for maintaining the landmarks, Daenerys allows him to give his father a proper burial. Thing is though, this isn't the sole issue Daenerys has. Her dragons are killing people's livelihoods, she has rebellions among her kingdoms, and then comes the issue of Tywin's increasing note of her accomplishments and rising power. Which leads him to possibly sending Daenerys a note, possibly in an attempt to broker peace before war breaks out.Topic 2: Reclaiming the Throne \u2013 Ser Davos Seaworth/ Stannis BaratheonBut while Tywin seems to have a strong focus on Daenerys, he seems to dismiss Stannis trying to get his second chance at King's Landing. One which the Iron Bank dismisses as well, at first, but thanks to Ser Devos speech about the greatness of his king, and noting how old Tywin is, and how his family is inept to pay back the Iron Bank, it seems the three person council may have renewed faith in the one who claims the Iron Throne. However, as of now all we see is Ser Devos reminding the king of his value, and him providing Salladhor Saan with gold to possibly assist in another naval attack. In the future though, no plans seem immediate as of now.Topic 3: The Trial of the Century - TyrionAs should be expected, Tyrion trial is the highlight of the episode. Peter Dinklage reminds us of why he has won awards for his role, and why Game of Thrones can be about more than sex, violence, and the cycle repeated. Though he isn't alone. Perhaps, oddly enough, some of the best actors of the show remain in King's Landing. Be it Oberyn and Lord Varys, both eccentrics, though Lord Varys being a far mysterious one; Cersei, whose complexity can drive her to either being a woman no less violent than the men on the show, or a maternal figure trapped in a patriarchal society, simply trying to survive; or others who partake in King's Landing drama.But I digress, with Tyrion's trial comes old enemies getting their stabs in and even some betrayals. Lord Varys, for example, likely to forward his ambitions, all but hands Tywin and Cersei the sword to cut Tyrion's head off, and then Shae appears and seemingly the words Tyrion said to make sure she would leave, she makes him eat each and every word. Anything kind he ever said was used against him, anything she could make up which seemed highly feasible was testified, and this all brings Tyrion to the point he sees no other option than to confess.Though not in the way Cersei nor Tywin wants. His confession is that of him speaking how he believes his father feels about him, his utter hatred for being betrayed so swiftly and openly, and not even getting the credit he is due for keeping Stannis from sitting on the Iron Throne. And while Jamie wished to save his brother, trade in being a king's guard, give Tywin heirs, just to save his brother's life, Tyrion throws this option away for a dual to prove his innocence, just as he did before in his last trial in the Vale. Though this time, question is who will be his champion and who will said champion face?",

                    "content": "I absolutely love the title sequence and love watching it change every time, and the Braavos one with the Titan is perhaps the most impressive one yet. Great visual effects, and including the gorgeous overhead CGI shot of the city in the opening scene, rivaling that of Meereen's. It's a testament to how big this show has gotten. Being a fan of Sherlock I was interested to see how Mark Gatiss would do as the Iron Bank representative. His calm aloofness is perfect for representing such a powerful company, and I feel Stannis is finally hitting his stride as a character willing to do anything to win the Iron throne. Ser Davos, however, was the one who stole this scene. It's telling how honourable and dedicated he still is to Stannis' claim. It's a cutting critique of the condition Westeros is in under the Lannister rule, so easily tipped into chaos by the smallest imbalance. Yara's monologue over his love for Theon, the prince of the Iron Islands was a very powerful bit of dialogue and set the tone for the rescue attempt. The score at the same time quickens and adds to the tension, making for a very emotionally charged reunion. Alfie Allen is hands down the best actor of this show. His portrayal of Reek is finally complete as he painstakingly begs his once sister to leave him alone, not even able to comprehend the thought of escape. Overall, the end result was a bit anti-climatic, although it may be a sign of Yara recognising how Theon was beyond repair. Iwan Rheon doesn't miss a beat as the psychotic Ramsay. It's chilling how they can make something like a bath so threatening and foreboding. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for some torture device hidden in the water. The clear and sunny scenes over in Essos make for a nice change from the dark dungeons and rooms of Westeros. More the better for the CGI to flourish, and that it did. Such a powerful scene showcased just how immense and frightening Drogon can be, and how large he is already. The introduction of Hizdahr was quite telling as it is the first sign of Dany making a mistake. She may in time learn of the consequences of her takeover of Meereen and her stance on slavery. Oberyn is a fan favourite and rightly so. Small things like not rising for Tywin show he is still at odds with the Lannisters and Tywin knows he cannot rebuke him for it, or risk starting a war. It's quite contrasting how everyone on the small council bar Cersei is worried about Dany over in Meereen, she is still as naive as she was last episode. The talk between Varys and Oberyn was interesting as they traded blows, and I get the feeling that Varys is doing much more behind the scenes than he accounts for. But the big scene everyone was waiting for was the trial of Tyrion. What a tense moment set up in the great hall and how crestfallen Tyrion looks after so much jail time. It's a nice little speech by Tommen to establish that Tywin really is in charge of orders, symbolic of him sitting on the Iron throne. A great callback to the slapping of Joffrey after the riot in season 2 and all the other ways in which Tyrion ruled over Joffrey as hand. It's utterly staged towards Tyrion being made in bad light and his chances diminished with every testimony. Even more damning is the evidence of Dontos and the necklace of Sansa. It's a nice touch by Littlefinger to leave that to further incriminate Tyrion as the accused. We flashback to Blackwater and Tyrion's threats to Cersei after capturing Ros, which set up the shocking reveal of the whore Shae to betray him. The look on Tyrion's face as she walked in was heartbreaking to see. Even more so after she swears to tell the truth, then blatantly lying and backstabbing him. And Tywin telling her to reiterate that she was a whore only made it worse when looking back at their relationship and how it disintegrated.Keep your mouth shut, no more outburst, Jaime said. But Peter Dinklage should take a bow for the following confession. The hatred on his face as he announces his hatred for the populace was stunning, and his guilt for being looked down upon as a dwarf. His absolute rage and delirious joy at watching Joffrey die is perhaps the best acting I have seen in this show yet, and his delivery of the final line was perfect in its loathing and malice. What an absolute brilliant episode. There was no scene wasted, no spare line of dialogue, no holds barred as Tyrion escalated his trial to a whole other level of tension. I eagerly await next week. 9.5/10",

Not only is it even better than the last three episodes, which were great but not nearly as excellent as the first two, but it raises the stakes for Tyrion Lannister to either be proved guilty or innocent after the death of King Joffrey in episode 2. Take for instance, the court scene where Peter Dinklage gives out the most epic speech in the entire show with this quote.\"I will not give my life for Joffrey's murder. And I know I'll get no justice here. So I will let the gods decide my fate. I demand a trial by combat.\" That line made this whole episode worth it. Everything else is still awesome. The storyline and script are still well-written, the dialog is even more compelling, the pacing's tight, the directing is fresh, the scenery and sets are still lavish, the characters and the relationships still shine, and the music score particularly in the background scene in the court is terrific. So, overall, another classic episode thanks to Peter Dinklage's epic performance.",

But i except this from Jamie.(I Expect that goat hunting from dragon, ref: season 4th trailer) Will theon have his revenge against Ramsay.??

In this episode things seem to take a large dramatic step and things really started to heat up. Several of the main characters make major plays and things fall into place from events set in motion long ago. The writing for this series is so well written how they develop their characters into such great depth and they continue to become more complex and interesting. One of those in particular took such a dark dramatic turn from what it once was in the beginning of the series. The last 15 minutes of this episode alone makes it one of the best and features some of the best dialogue, writing and especially acting of the series.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 4 was a great season with none of the episodes being less than very good. Even thought \"Oathkeeper\" was great, regardless of its treatment of the source material that upset a number of fans. Alongside \"The Lion and the Rose\" and \"The Laws of Gods and Men\", \"Mockingbird\" is one of the season's best. \"Mockingbird\" does mainly set up what is to follow, and it does that brilliantly. But it doesn't feel like an episode that does just that and nothing else, there is much more to \"Mockingbird\" than just set up and filler. It is also an episode that is surprising, suspenseful and emotional with a good deal going on without feeling that there is too much of it. Although all the cast are superb, with not a weak link, once again Peter Dinklage is particularly brilliant. His performance may not quite be the powerhouse than in \"The Laws of Gods and Men\", but Dinklage does prove why he is a fan favourite and one of the main reasons why 'Game of Thrones' is as popular as it is.Visually, \"Mockingbird\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Mockingbird\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.In summary, wonderful. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The material with Tyrion in his cell is GAME OF THRONES at its most basic - two characters chatting in an enclosed backdrop, but the quality of the performances is phenomenal. Elsewhere, the scenes with the Hound and Arya are extremely touching and unexpected, but the real winner are the scenes set at the Eyrie, with Littlefinger at his most scheming and dastardly best.",

Of course, the focus is Tyrion, who must now find a champion, someone who is willing to risk his life for the little guy. Jaime has already laid into him for his rant against Cersei and Tyrin and the betrayal of Shae. You can't blame them when you see the giant they are going to have to face. Meanwhile, Sansa and Littlefinger are finding their ways at the Ayrie with that goofball woman and her wimpy son. Arya and the Hound are the odd couple. He is attacked and bitten and this is going to be something we know is going to have an issue with. His fear of fire is possibly going to be the death of him. Dany get in the sack with her new guy. Brienne is without a doubt one of the neatest characters. She is showing some weakness at times. She and Pod must really appear strange together.",

Tyrion asks Jaime to bring Bronn to talk to him. Bronn visits Tyrion and also declines to be his champion. He explains that Cercei has chosen the dangerous The Mountain to be her champion and bribed him, offering a noble woman to marry him. Out of the blue, Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion and surprisingly offers to be his champion. Daenerys spends the night with Daario and in the morning, Jorah stumbles with Daario living her room. Daenerys explains that asked him to go to Yunkai to kill the masters to control the city, but Jorah convinces her to bring justice without execution. Arya kills Rorge at a house burnt to the ground and gets closer to The Hound. Brienne and Pod dine at an inn where Hot Pie works and then he tells that Arya is alive with The Hound. Jon Snows unsuccessfully tries to convince the Night's Watch to seal the tunnel with ice to protect Castle Black from an invasion. Sansa has a friction and slaps Robin and Littlefinger witnesses her attitude and tells to Sansa to not worry. Then he kisses her, but Lysa sees from a window. Lysa summons Sansa and threatens to throw her through the Moon Door, but Littlefinger protects Sansa. Then he throws Lysa out through the Moon Door.\"Mockingbird\" is another great episode of \"Game of Thrones\", where Peter Dinklage steals the show. The dialogs between Tyrion and Jaime, Bronn and Oberyn are awesome, and the explanation of Oberyn about the birth of Tyrion is heartbreaking. Arya is another impressive character and it is amazing how brutal she is becoming to survive. Littlefinger, together with Cercei, are maybe the most despicable characters to this show. Let 's see the fate of Sansa after the death of Lysa. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Mockingbird\"",

                    "content": "After Tyrion's speech in the previous episode the trial is over and he is back in his dungeon. Jaime pays him a visit and he is disappointed to learn that his brother won't act as his champion; he hasn't learnt to fight with his left hand and would stand no chance against Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane, who Cersei has chosen to represent her. Tyrion has no more luck when he asks Bronn to fight for him; he has been bought off with an attractive bribe and the prospect of a castle\u0085 and understandably isn't keen to fight The Mountain. It is his third visitor who provides a surprise by offering to fight for Tyrion\u0085 none other than the Lannister hating Oberyn Martell.Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys orders Daario Naharis to take the Second Sons to retake Yunkai and kill all of the masters; Jorah Mormont counsels her to be merciful and changes her mind. At Castle Black Jon Snow advises the Night's Watch to block the tunnel through the wall before Mance Rayder's forces arrive but his advice falls of deaf ears. Arya and The Hound are continuing on their way to the Eyrie and are attacked giving Arya another chance to use Needle. As Brienne and Podrick stop at an inn for a meal they learn that Arya is alive and being taken to the Eyrie. Finally at the Eyrie Sansa strikes Robin and is kissed by Lord Baelish\u0085 either of which could enrage her mad aunt.There might not be a huge amount of action in this episode; just one gory scene where The Mountain dispatches a bunch of no-hopers forced to fight him; that doesn't mean this isn't a fine instalment. There is also a great scene where Arya kills a soldier; he has her sword in his heart before he even knows she is a danger to him; Maisie Williams was brilliant in this scene. As one might expect Peter Dinklage is fantastic as Tyrion talks to his three visitors and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, Jerome Flynn and Pedro Pascal impress as Jaime Lannister, Bronn and Oberyn Martell. The final scene, at the Eyrie, is impressive and quite shocking; Sophie Turner is getting better and better as Sansa, possibly because her character is getting more to do, Aidan Gillen was great as Lord Baelish; just about everything his character does should make him unlikeable but every so often he does something that makes the viewer cheer for him and Kate Dickie impressed as Sansa's mad aunt Lysa as she spoke of what happened to those who went through the moon gate before trying to push Sansa out. Overall another fine episode with many great scenes; even the secondary scenes are enjoyable and advanced the plot.",

                    "content": "As we creep further and further toward the finale, you are left wondering if The Purple Wedding will be the sole big event of the season. Well, from what it seems, this may not be so. For with a few major events in this episode, we are assured some good combat, as well as uneasy alliances. But, will any of it cumulate into something epic? Well, only time will tell.Topic 1: The Situation at the Wall \u2013 Jon SnowWith Jon Snow returning triumphantly, Ser Alliser has failed his first attempt to rid himself of Jon Snow. To make things worse though, with Jon's return comes the recommendation to seal off the tunnel which leads to the north. Sealing off this tunnel would make it harder for the Wildlings, but destroy a major pathway. So, Alliser naturally is against this and is quick to note Jon is a steward and not a builder, so he decides to ask the builder commander his opinion, and the builder replies that his isn't a good idea.So, to add insult to rejection, Jon is forced to keep watch during the night for Wildlings, as it seems Castle Black remains vulnerable.Topic 2: The Queen's Orders - DaenerysAs usual, Daario Naharis flirts with Daenerys, but this time is different. In what can be seen as a slightly odd move, Daenerys takes to Daario's loyalty and words, and asks him to strip. And seemingly, the next morning when Daario leaves, and informs Ser Jorah the queen is in a good move, we can only assume they slept together. Be it so he would shut up, her needing sex, or simply because she realizes he would be far more loyal, and perhaps powerful, if he believed he had something, or rather someone, to fight for.Either way, Ser Jorah isn't the fondest of the relationship, but Daenerys reassures him that she doesn't fully trust Daario, but seemingly recognizes his worth. Enough so that he is to go to Yunkai to reclaim the city, and kill the masters. Leading to Ser Jorah to repeat Ser Barristan warning that perhaps Daenerys need try mercy. For, after all, if Lord Stark didn't show him mercy, he wouldn't be standing where he is today. And with this, Ser Jorah breaks through to Daenerys and convinces her to give an ultimatum to the masters who can either accept her rule, or die.Topic 3: Odd Alliances \u2013 Arya/ The Hound; Sansa/ Lord Baelish; Tyrion/ OberynWith Arya and The Hound, there is this weird relationship which goes from Arya wanting to kill The Hound, to her acting like his mentee. In this episode, that mentee/ mentor relationship is seen with The Hound teaching her where to pierce Needle to stab someone in the heart, helping her get a new kill. But, the cute part of their interaction comes with The Hound opening himself up to her on why he fears fire, much less how bad his relationship is with his brother. With this, while there isn't a Tyrion level performance, you do see The Hound develop just the slightest bit.As for sister Sansa, the Vale has allowed her peace, and some form of happiness, for she can roam as she pleases and is surrounded by extended family. Issue is though, with Lysa's jealousy and Robin being a Joffrey in the making, things seemingly could only be perfect for a limited time basis. Of which, seemingly Petyr decides to be the one which sets the bomb off for he decides to kiss Sansa. The reason? Well, being that he loved Catelyn, and now only has Sansa, I guess having her daughter beats not having her at all. But what makes the whole situation weird is that before the kiss he talks about how if things were different, Sansa would have been his daughter.But that situation isn't the only one which makes Lysa fuming mad. The 2nd sign that the happy moments are to be over is when Sansa realizes how immature Robin is. You see, Sansa decides to rebuild Winterfell out of snow to remind herself of home, and while Robin first seems sweet in his own way by talking about how life will be when they are married and how he will kill her enemies upon a word, with his lack of understanding on how Winterfell doesn't have a moon door comes him showing his age. He tries to fix Sansa's snow creation and ends up upsetting her, and he takes enough offense to this for them to have a verbal altercation which ends in her slapping him. Something Lysa doesn't take note of when she confronts Sansa, for Peytr kissing her is far more important. Unfortunately for Lysa though, Petyr's loyalty is more to the Catelyn and Sansa than her, so she is thrown down into the moon door and dies.Leaving us with Tyrion. With two prospective champions, both Bron and his brother saying they can't help, it seems Tyrion is to fight a man known as \"The Mountain\" himself. But then Oberyn steps in and speaks on how he first met Tyrion when he was a baby. He speaks on the rumors of this monstrous looking creature that Cersei hyped up, and upon realizing Tyrion was just a big headed baby, not only was he disappointed, but seemingly took pity on Tyrion. And be it that Tyrion isn't considered to be like the rest of the Lannisters, or Oberyn just wants to make a scene, he proclaims he will be Tyrion's champion, and the scene between them, having someone show kindness to Tyrion with nothing to gain and all to lose, is quite a tear jerker. Further proving that Peter Dinklage is truly the highlight of the show, and anyone who gets to have a scene with him is extremely lucky.",

                    "content": "F**k your own sister. Tyrion is at the end of his road, and he hardly cares what his tongue lets out, even to his own brother. Though perhaps there is desperation there in finding a champion. Who would fight for a murderer? A smile on both their faces and a bit of brotherly love and humanity for just one moment was nice. We are brought back to his harsh reality when we realise the Mountain that Rides will be Cersei's champion. The actor, a strongman, is massive and intimidating in his butchering of those prisoners, a bad omen for Tyrion's champion. A absolutely chilling scene from Oberyn was firstly set up from some great back-story about him and Elia visiting Tyrion when they were younger. As he recounts Cersei's hatred for Tyrion even as a baby you can see tears in Tyrion's eyes. Fantastic acting, and Oberyn announcing himself as champion topped it all off. Can't wait for the fight. A very heavy moment of realisation for Arya as they come across a dying man. She preaches that nothing is worse than death, and even the Hound shows a little mercy, but we still see Arya unflinching accept that there are casualties in war. The surprise attack from Rorge was a bit anti-climatic, but at least Arya is learning with that stab to the heart. Great bit of characterisation with the Hound's story about his scars, something he has probably never told anyone else. It shows how close they are getting and how Arya is also learning to care for him a little. I find new Daario a bit lacking, his delivery of his lines doesn't compare to the old swagger of the previous actor. Safe to say that Dany so quickly falling for this sellsword was a bit disappointing and the nudity a bit unnecessary. So was the nudity in Mel's scene, but I did like how Selyse brought up her and Stannis' infidelity as a non-sin in service of the Lord of Light. It really captures how devoted she is that she would let Stannis sleep with Mel. I felt a little sorry for Jorah as he bumps into a shirtless Daario outside Dany's chambers but he still is steadfast in his beliefs and that is admirable. His advice is very telling as he himself was given mercy after slave trading and wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for Ned Stark, which Dany takes to heart, trusting him to deal with the slavers in Yunkaii. A real nice cameo from Hot Pie and his gravy at the inn where so much has happened. He might be a little behind on current events given he think Arya is still with the Brotherhood without Banners, but it's the thought that counts, shown by his vastly improved bread direwolf. As most GOT episodes go, they save the best till last and that is certainly true here. A few episodes ago we got the reveal that Littlefinger masterminded Jon Arryn's death and everything else but he tops it here. But first we get a touching scene from Sansa as she struggles to find any lasting remnants of her family and Winterfell in her snow castle. The Winterfell theme in the background was a nice touch. Kate Dickie is fantastic as the maniacal and crazy Lysa and I will miss her performance. Her freak out at Sansa and Petyr's kiss and nearly killing Sansa was so great and her tears seemed genuine. Petyr was as cold as ever as he uttered the final words she will ever hear. I wish it could have been 'Only Cat', but oh well, still a spectacular ending to the episode.9/10",

And the fight is against 'The Mountain'. Arya and Hound comes across some dying farmer and are ambushed. they kill one men each but Hound is wounded. Hound tells Arya about how he had it hard in childhood and only his elder brother 'The Mountain' was liked by their father. Daario succeeds in scoring with Daenerys.

The first sees an opportunity to try and right some of the wrongs of his past and makes complete sense looking back on everything this season and I'm sure many even saw this coming. The other, probably the most devious mastermind of them all (in my opinion), is constantly manipulating everything and everyone around him for his own personal current and future advancement. Nothing is ever as it seems with this character, and the only thing you can predict with him is that he will make himself better off. By the end of this episode you will may become a little angry due to the fact that you have to wait a week until the next episode.

The episode begins with another amazing dialogue exchange between the two Lannister brothers Peter and Nickolaj, The \"Golden son\" won't be able to fight for his little brother, because \"the kingslayer\" is cripple now and according to him he can't even slay a pigeon. Well Tyrion's only hope left is the sell sword made knight , Bronn . Oh well, destiny's a B-word . And Cersei has her hands tied up where ever she can, The turns in the show , the happenings we don't expect the strange outcomes , that gives the real grace to the Game O' Thrones. So about Bronn , he is about to marry a Lollys stokeworth and he wishes to become the lord there. Also the last few words between the two friends were kinda sad. Therefore Tyrion's gotta fight The Mountain by himself, who has just arrived in the capital on the \"mother of madness'\" demand . Talking about the mountain , who hates him the most? Yes that's right the Red Viper Oberyn Martell, The Dornish prince whose sister and her children were murdered by the big brother Clegane. After the amazing little thought exchange between Tyrion and Oberyn , he decides to become the champion for the little Lannister to exact vengeance on the Mountain. The happiness flows through the dwarf cause he just got one of the best fighters in the Westeros on his side.The landscapes where they shot the travels of The Hound and Arya are fascinating. Also every scene played by Maisie Williams and Rory McCann is just outstanding. I always kinda hope to wait for the little talk between the two which is just amazingly scripted and played.Daario, got what Jorah couldn't . The guy has charm and more over he has guts. So I think he made out with Daenerys which was well, we all kinda knew it was coming. But poor Ser friendzoned Mormont could do nothing but watch Daario walk out of her personal quarters, so Jorah talks to Daenerys about some Yunkai stuff and so on and she decides to do as he said.I will wrap things up by the main event of the episode.\"The not so little finger\" Petyr Baelish . Did Petyr just kiss the Stark girl? Holy S-word, dude she is at the age of being your daughter . This guy is crazy as *#$@ . So the loving wife to Petyr and the Aunt to Sansa witnesses the moment, calls the girl and is about to make her fly through the moon door , when the Saviour arrives . He loved only one woman and that was the other Tully girl, pushes the aunt through the moon door , with this Petyr's list of \"Blood on my hands\" is increased by plus one. Overall the episode was EPIC as ever, the more I watch the show the more I can't get enough , even though I have read all the books, but watching these guys and girls come alive and played by the outstanding cast is just heart warming. I love this show and it'll be really sad to witness the end of this season after another three weeks. But I hope the next book comes out ASAP so we can all hook up with the GOT madness again.",

Does that mean we should put it on TV as well? I don't think so.So, in regards to the sex we've seen in this season so far, there has been no sex portrayed that is not sex done with violence or sex with prostitutes. In the past seasons, there have been some love making scenes, which have been 'better' alternatives, but what really angers me about this episode is that it was finally Danearys turn to get some, it was finally time for the directors and producers of this series to show sex from a woman's perspective. This is where they had an opportunity to show it in an angle from what women want, and what happens instead? Dario gets naked, and they cut the scene short right there and switched to the Red Woman's breasts. Thanks! Thanks to all the male producers who only think about their own gender and what their own gender wants when it comes to sex. From a woman's perspective, I am sick and tired of seeing another woman's naked body.",

This is my first review and its not for anything else but all about this episode, i cant tell how much i love this episode, its totally magnificent according to me. It's that sort of episode where you say to yourself that: this episode is better than lots of other series finale i have ever witnessed. I cannot describe my OMG moments in words for this episode. For me Oberyn Martel was the biggest moments of my OMG, even more than Littlefinger moments.I think next episode would be much about Littlefinger and Tyrion. Well i guess we all have to survive until 1 Jun. 2014.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 4 was a great season with none of the episodes being less than very good. Even thought \"Oathkeeper\" was great, regardless of its treatment of the source material that upset a number of fans. \"The Mountain and the Viper\" is another example of Season 4 and 'Game of Thrones' overall being on peak form, while having a marginal preference for \"The Lion and the Rose\" and \"The Laws of Gods and Men\" as far as previous episodes go. The final fight scene is the most touted scene of \"The Mountain and the Viper\" and often considered an episode highlight. No wonder, it is full of intensity and suspense, if not for the squeamish (it is one of the show's most gruesome scenes up to this point), and is then capped off with a shocking twist that leaves fans aghast and anxious to see the next episode.But it's not just that scene. The interplay between Daeneys and Jorah has a subtle tension and engrosses and Littlefinger and Tyrion are awesome. As always with 'Game of Thrones', the acting is superb. Pedro Pascal, Aidan Gillen and Peter Dinklage are particular knockouts though Charles Dance and Emilia Clarke are also excellent.Visually, \"The Mountain and the Viper\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Mountain and the Viper\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Summing up, 'Game of Thrones' does it again with another Season 4 winner. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

However, that's not to forget the rest of the good stuff that comes before that. The sub-plot involving Jorah's treachery is heartbreaking thanks to Iain Glen's acting; the scenes with Arya and the Hound are on fire; and Littlefinger teaching Sansa how to properly play the GAME OF THRONES for the first time in the whole season is priceless. I could have done without the cell chat between Tyrion and Jaime, but the rest works incredibly well.",

He ends up picking the perfect champion, one who has incredible agility and fighting skills, enough to defeat the monster. The problem is that he is possessed. He is filled with hatred for what the Giant has done to his family, and is not satisfied with just killing him. Meanwhile, Littlefinger is interrogated, concerning the death of the queen (for which he is responsible). Sansa defends him and makes it appear the Queen committed suicide. But what are her real motives? Is she coming into her own as a counter threat. We shall see. Then there is Dany who is beginning to reveal more and more bad judgment. Then there is Jorah. This is the man that is more responsible than anyone for where she is. She can't forgive. Her inconsistent compassion is making her reign harder and harder. Arya and the Hound finally get to where the ransom is to be paid, but the person who had the money has died. Arya goes into hysterical laughter as the Hound realizes he will get nothing for all his efforts. It is pronounced at the end that Tyrion's champion has failed and so Tyrion will face execution. I have to wait several days to see the next episode. Please help me be a patient man.",

When Sam hears the new in Castle Black, he becomes worried with Gilly but his friends comfort him telling that Gilly is a survivor. A boy gives a scroll to Barristan with the pardon of Jorah signed by Robert Baratheon and Daenerys expels him from the city. Littlefinger is explaining the death of his wife Lysa to a court and Sansa is asked to testify as a witness and she lies to protect him. Oberyn fights against the Mountain and wants him to confess that he raped and killed his sister Elia Martell. \"The Mountain and the Viper\" makes worthy wait for two weeks without \"Game of Thrones\" since it is among the best episodes of this show. The arrival of the Wildlings near Castle Black increases the tension among the 102 Night's Watch since they can not hold 100,000 Wildlings. I believe Daenerys will regret to send Jorah away since he was an experienced adviser. What is the hidden agenda of Sansa? The conclusion of the show is a cold shower with the unexpected twist. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"The Mountain and the Viper\"",

When news of the raid reaches Castle Black the members of the Night's Watch ponder how they could possibly prevail when Mance Rayder's army of 100,000 reach the wall. Further south, but still in The North, Iwan Rheon uses Theon to take Moat Cailin from the Iron Born and is rewarded by his father. In Meereen Daenerys learns that her long-time confidante Ser Jorah had been reporting on her to Robert Baratheon\u0085 he may have been dead for over a year and Ser Jorah had been loyal since but that wasn't enough to save him from being exiled from Meereen. In the Eyrie Lord Baelish is questioned about Lysa's death; he is only saved when Sansa has been brought in and tells how Lord Baelish had saved her in King's Landing and had tried to save Lysa when she jumped\u0085 luckily her lie matched Baelish's. Arya and The Hound finally reach their destination only to learn of Lysa's death\u0085 leading to a surprising reaction from Arya! Finally in King's Landing the time has come for the fight between The Mountain and Oberyn Martell.This season keeps getting better and better\u0085 and we haven't even reach episode nine which is traditionally the most impressive! It starts with the action in Mole's Town and ends with one of the series best one-on-one fights. This final fight was as shocking as it was thrilling. Pedro Pascal was brilliant as Oberyn Martell; challenging The Mountain to confess to what he did to his sister as he lands blow after blow and appears to prevail\u0085 all leading to a shockingly brutal end that leaves us wondering what will happen to Tyrion now. The Scenes in and around the Eyrie may not have contained any action but they were enjoyable; Sophie Turner was great as Sansa as she delivered her defence of Lord Baelish and Maisie Williams was equally good as Arya; her reaction to hearing of her aunt's death was priceless\u0085 I think it was the first time we've heard her laugh! The scenes in Meereen were rather sad as despite how things started Jorah Mormont had grown to be Daenerys's most loyal friend; I hope they can be reconciled before too long but this being 'Game of Thrones' I wouldn't bet on it.",

The fight between Oberyn and the Mountain is a memorable one. Grace (Oberyn) vs force, (the Mountain). The John Show character story line about the upcoming attack is dragging. A well written, character driven episode. I wish the Oberyn character lasted longer. It would not surprise me if Oberyn poisoned Jeffery for Jeffrey's grandfather. Could be the plot for next season? Will the daughter forgive her dad for killing her son?",

                    "content": "Warning do not read unless seen episode.There really isn't much to say, some of the scenes before the one on one fight were solid. I always like the back and forth scenes between both Jamme and Tyron both I feel have a healthy sibling relationship as opposed to their relations with the rest of the Lanaster family.But of course it all comes down to the fight which to me is one of my favorite one on one battles of all time. In a way it was sort of once again the David vs. Goliath battle. The Viper we clearly can see has a big advantage over the Mountain as he has agility, acrobatics, speed, and skill where as the mountain relies only on his brute strength and despite welding a sword he obviously has very little skill and coordination to weld it as we see him just stupidly swing his sword a bit randomly.The chirography was just spot on excellent as we see the Viper utilizing the spear with Wu Shu martial arts movements and just going to town on the mountain. The fight goes so well that he topples the mountain and delivers a fatal blow which gives the mountain a slow death (though personally I would of double tapped him). Just seeing him down I couldn't help but chear and know that tables are finally turning for Tyron. And of course who can forget that line he keeps reciting which is similar to the famous line from the film \"The Princess Bride\".But unfortunately fate doesn't smile on the Viper as we see the Viper gets a tad cocky/careless and fraks up when he gets too close to the mountain, obsessively urging the mountain to confess to his crimes. And of course as an old saying goes \"be careful what you wish for, you just might get it.\" and get it the Viper does when we see the mountain in his last moments of life give that confession while giving the Viper a fatality worthy of the \"Mortal Kombat\" video games. When I saw that I thought \"damn\" but also just as the Viper's head was crushed so was our last hope of Tyron's life.I can't help but feel what happened is also part of the morality of the series (if you can believe that) the moral to me is to quit while your ahead. If you have a clear shot at victory then take it, don't frak around. But also to not get lost in the forest of revenge, the Viper unfortunately got lost in that forest and slithered straight toward a cliff.Rating: 4 stars",

                    "content": "I love and hate this show. I love it because the characters all have such potential, and sometimes it is realized, but I hate this show since anyone is eligible to die and it almost seems like their death could have been prevented. Which is why I call this an emotionally draining episode for you are given a good performance out of Sansa, you get to see Ramsay have a touching moment with his father, Arya making it to the Vale, and then there is Tyrion's champion Oberyn versus The Mountain.Topic 1: Betrayal & Love \u2013 Theon/ Daenerys & Missandei/ Grey WormWith Ramsay having full control over Theon (Reek), he has him infiltrate one of his (Theon's) father's castles and convinces the men to surrender under the ruse that no harm will come to them. But, with Ramsay orchestrating the plan, not only are they all killed, but fillet. Leading me to wonder how many times Ramsay may try this trick as Lord Bolton seeks to be undisputed in the north?Switching to Daenerys, the letter Tywin sent seemingly is a pardon from the former king Robert Baratheon to one Ser Jorah. This letter is given to Ser Barriston, and then to Daenerys. With this information comes a deep wound in Daenerys' back and knowing her confidant betrayed her leads her to slightly mixed feelings. Only slightly because she really should kill Ser Jorah for reporting, in the past, to lord Varys, but for time spent she decides to banish him from her sight instead. Thus making Tywin's plan of slowly fracturing Daenerys' kingdom begin, something Ser Jorah notes as he pleads with Daenerys to no avail.But while those two have quite a dramatic moment, multiple sweet ones come between Missandei and Grey Worm. As we know, Grey Worm is quite taken by Missandei's intelligence and beauty, but with him being unsullied she seemingly assumed any interest he had in her was strictly to be a better soldier. However, with him watching her naked body, and her feeling a bit of shame due to his glare, Missandei asks Daenerys what she thinks as Daenerys braids her hair, making for a rather nice girl talk moment. Sadly though, with Daenerys not knowing much of the Unsullied besides their reputation, she is unsure. Leaving us with but Grey Worm apologizing for staring, though Misssandei forgiving him and sort of happy he did. He returns the joy and we are left hoping that maybe something good may come of this.Topic 2: This Is Politics \u2013 Ramsay, Jon, and SansaSwitching back to Ramsay, with Theon helping him obtain a fortress, his father bestows a great honor onto Ramsay. Lord Bolton discards the surname Snow from Ramsay and fully claims him as his son, a Bolton. A moment which honestly brought tears to my eyes for as nuts as Ramsay is, a lot of his moments of madness have stemmed from him simply wanting to impress his father, and now he has. But while Ramsay's accomplishments impress Lord Bolton, the Wildlings march toward Castle Black is striking fear in the Night's Watch. For with an assumed 100,000 warriors against the Night's Watch measly 100+, they don't stand a chance. Though when Ygritte finally faces Jon once more, oh what a sight that maybe. For while she shows she may not be as ruthless as the others, as she spares Gilly her death, Jon and her have a need for a real heart to heart. In which she may end up literally having his heart in her hand, with his balls as a necklace.As for Sansa, with Baelish standing trial before the leaders of the Vale, Sansa gives her testimony and saves Baelish, if just because she feels she can predict her future better with Baelish around than with him dead. With his life saved though comes a bit of confidence in Sansa. Her lying has improved and she seems ready to really enter politics. Then Lord Baelish seems to have plans for Robin in which he may one day be king, or die and make Baelish king of the Vale. One cannot be sure. What is known though is that the Stark sisters are possibly to be reunited for Arya can see the castle Sansa is in. Though with Sansa on her way out, they may pass each other by just like Bran did with Jon.Topic 3: A Mountain vs. a Viper \u2013 Oberyn & TyrionThe episode saves what we all were waiting for as the last bit, and after some delay in which Tyrion foreshadows what is to happen, we watch Oberyn and The Mountain battle, and learn why Oberyn decided to be Tyrion's champion. You see, The Mountain is the one who killed Elia and raped her, so as much as he maybe helping Tyrion out of pity, he also seeks a confession.One in which takes a year and a day to get for between Oberyn's theatrics, and the endurance of The Mountain, their battle lasts awhile. However, Oberyn really does a number on the mountain to the point you can see Cersei and Tywin worried. That is until Oberyn gets cocky, The Mountain grabs him, and kills him just like he killed Elia. Leading Tywin to quickly, and with such glee, announce the impending death of his own son. Which means we may have another main character die, though the books say he won't. But, with there always being a chance the writers may change things to keep us anxiety ridden, anything may truly happen.",

                    "content": "It's a tendency to use the night setting for fights in Westeros in order to increase the sense of confusion and chaos as we saw this week at Mole's Town. I can't say I love it, but the lighting is at least adequate for us to admire Ygritte's brief moment of humanity. More hopeful was Sam and his brothers reminding us just how resilient Gilly is, as well as the impending dangers of the Wilding assault on Castle Black. The Grey Worm/Missandei love story was lacklustre to say the least. I saw it as little more than an extra bit of nudity pushed in for a relationship that wouldn't develop or go anywhere anyway. One of the weakest scenes of the season so far. A more dramatic reveal in Tywin's letter finally reaching Meereen sees Jorah's prior intentions laid bare. Barristan's scenes are sparely used and never really utilise the legendary knight's presence but we see a bit of it here. His loyalty to Dany is admirable and Jorah is left with no choice but to confess. Emilia Clarke puts on a great performance as she lays out her contempt and unforgiving nature. The dynamic of Reek and Ramsay continue to steal their scenes. It's a complete transformation of the proud, arrogant and strong Theon from the time he took Winterfell and flayed boys for the sake of it. Alfie Allen takes it to new heights with his 'portrayal' of Theon, son of Balon as he attempts to lift the siege of Moat Caitlin. It's a shallow and weary impression of confidence and we see a falter in his facade as he mutters Reek over and over again in fear. What was more gruesome was the lack of mercy Ramsay gives to the surrendering Ironborn and the result of that: their sigil, a flayed man.The relationship between Roose and Ramsay is a complicated one but you get the sense Roose is fiercely protective of his house name and lineage. In a scene reminiscent of Mufasa showing Simba the Pride-lands in Lion King, we see Ramsay legitimised. House Bolton is here and they are here to stay. It's nice to see Littlefinger back to his witty and confident self after all the lurking and plotting in the shadows. The Lords Declarant of the Vale show up to find justice in the wake of Lysa's death, and find a new player of the game in Petyr's 'niece', Alayne. It's a far cry from the weak and helpless Sansa in King's Landing, now finally realising her potential and giving a passionate acting performance to boost Petyr's credibility. It's chilling to see Littlefinger sit in silence, so rarely helpless as Sansa lays bare her testimony. A great act by Sansa completely sells the story and solidifies Petyr now as Lord Protector of the Vale. The Hound and Arya's banter is once again natural and great and they seem very comfortable with each other. Comfortable enough that Arya's insane, cackling laugh is a brief lull from all the death and pain. In what may be the last brotherly scene we get, Tyrion and Jaime both seem rather calm before the storm. The beetles talk was quite the foreshadowing of the great chaos and irrelevance of most characters in the Game of Thrones world, most just beetles in the background. But not Tyrion, the heir to the Lannisters, the accused murdered of the king, the half-man. Pedro Pascal's \"I'm going to kill that\" is quite the epic line but even the most ardent supporters of Oberyn may have been as worried as Ellaria at the sight of the man mountain, Gregor Clegane. This was what we had waited for. It's quite the spectacle Oberyn puts on a show for the crowd. We got the \"Some dead man\" from Gregor but Oberyn is determined to draw out the truth of her sister's fate those long years ago. The fight choreography is nothing short of brilliant as we feast on the acrobatics of the Red Viper and the crude, tiring swings of the Mountain. The iconic lines \"You raped her, you murdered her, you killed her children\" had finally come to life. For a moment there Oberyn's victory seems certain as he repeated those chilling lines to the murderer of his sister, Elia of Dorne. Then it came, the brutal CRUNCH as the Mountain gouged out his confession and Oberyn's eyes and leaving a mess on the floor as well as the hearts of Ellaria, Tyrion and all show watchers devastated. 9/10 (Though that last scene is perfect in itself.)",

                    "content": "Initially I had given this episode a 10/10. I took a star away because in retrospect a few things started bothering me. The Eyrie storyline was well acted throughout, and gives Sansa a new direction which had slowly been building up. There are some big differences from the books, such as revealing her identity, but since they had already changed quite a lot with how Lysa's death played out, that's probably justified. I still feel her storyline was accelerated too much, but the reasons become clear with Arya and the Hound arriving just after Lysa's death - some changes in timeline have to be made to accommodate the series' pace. The wildling attack in Molestown and the Night's Watch preparation for the incoming attack were rather similar to all the previous scenes in the previous episodes where the same stuff happened. Overall, the build up for the attack on Castle Black hasn't been quite satisfying, but you can't have it all. For once, what goes on in Daenerys' camp was half-interesting, with the revelation of Jorah's betrayal (while the romance between Missandei and Grey Worm was just an excuse for boobs). The difference from the source material here is not insignificant - in the books, Jorah and Barristan are judged together by Daenerys, and Jorah is sent away not for spying on her, but more or less for refusing to apologize. I don't mind the change here, since it makes Daenerys look bad. Theon and Ramsay's part I didn't like that much - it does very little to show just how important Moat Cailin is, and worse for me, Roose seems almost proud of Ramsay. It is one of the more interesting traits of his character that book-Roose despises his bastard, believing him to have murdered his trueborn heir. I understand there is less room for character development, but focusing more on Roose than Ramsay would be nice.And coming to the essence of the episode, the duel between Oberyn and the Mountain is almost exquisitely done - but a couple of things do leave a bad taste, not just due to the outcome. Unlike others I didn't find the beetle story pointless, but it did last more than it should have. There seemed to be too little time left for the combat, but it proved enough. Still, less beetles would have allowed the inclusion of some more dialogue between Gregor and Oberyn (I'm thinking of \"If you die before you say her name, I will hunt you through all 7 Hells\", which ought to have been there). The actual fight was close enough to the book description, and well executed, with Bj\u00f6rnsson's acting being much better than expected. But there was something wrong with the brutal ending. I don't mind gore at all. In this case though, they seemed to turn an already brutal death into something even more horrific just to make sure even those who knew the outcome would be shocked. Even GRRM didn't go that far in his description - Oberyn basically dies from a massive punch. His death is already another unjust blow against all that is good with the world, the excessive grotesqueness of it is a little sadistic on the writers' part.",

                    "content": "Games of Thrones has always had a trait for the unpredictable; tonight we just got another dose of it like the bloody wedding of last season.Prince Oberyn Martel was probably one of the most colorful characters since I have been watching this show. He had a sense of perception and conviction. His bisexuality was his liberation or defiance, he had a keen sense of conviction to his integrity. He would not allow politics to manipulate the truth when he was chosen as one of the judges. He had suffered a loss and was on a mission to revenge his sister's death. I really thought his character was going to be around for a long time, even for the remainder of the show to maybe form some kind of alliance against the Lannisters. I have never read the books to know what is a head,so that was what I was hoping or wishing as probably most of the viewers did too. Just like last season when Rob Stark, his wife and mother got killed, who would have ever predicated that to happen all in one episode. This episode once again reminded us that every character is expendable. As much as this show is fantasy/fiction yet it resides on the edge of harsh reality of how things happen in real life. We are not watching some typical good versus evil, where the good guys win, to reconfirm the same repetitive clich\u00e9s of child like wishes. Martelle's overconfidence, need for vanity to display his acrobatic ballet like fight skills was among the reasons to his demise. His deep rooted anger for revenge made him drunk with rage, it blinded him to the unpredictable cunning nature of his enemy. I had a feeling prior to the fight starting that Martell's overconfidence maybe his weak spot. But his rage became his enemy and weakness. His hesitation to kill Gregon by demands to confess his crimes gave Gregor time and the upper hand to use Martell's rage against him; the more he didn't reply the angrier Martell became, Gregor's silence was his strategy to weaken the man he could not catch. Gregor had no emotional investment in the fight, he was just a hired killer. When Martell finally had Gregor on the ground, he got consumed with victory, parading around Gregor to force a confession, that was his biggest mistake. Instead killing the beast instead he actually helped Gregor to regain strength by pulling out the spear from his chest to fight back. What didn't make sense was to get a confession you may apply more pain like cutting his finger or hand, Martell's emotions got the best of him that cost him his life. Gregor waited for the right moment as Martell danced around him. while pretending to be immobilized, he waited for his prey to come to him. What followed was so quick and unexpected in just seconds for Martell with the bone crushing punch and tooth flying out kept us all in disbelief as his eyes and head was getting crushed Gregor found his lost tongue to even add more pain to utter Martell's sister's name to be the last words Martell hears before his head exploded. This Fourth season is not much different than season three in terms of pace. Every episode is filled with maybe few key scenes that move the story forward, the rest is numerous dialogues that go no where. This entire season has been kind of dragging, predictable in pace of its presentation, contrary to the unpredictable nature of the show itself. We didn't even see Theon's sister until the 6th episode of this season, she and her father are part of the North and key characters who serve the greater part of story. She appeared in less than 3 scenes to rescue her brother Theon, we have not seen her return to her home to her father since that episode either, but we keep getting these tedious scenes with \"Samwell Tarly\", talking about the pride of being of brotherhood in night's watch, his regrets about Lilly. I just don't know what is his importance in this story compare to the problems facing the invasion of the North.Lord Bolton is finally gaining ground in the north, his bastard insane son \"Ramsy\" now got more power to do more killing with his father's seal. Tonight's episode, death of Martell was just another shock episode kept for the final three, like the bloody wedding of last season. It's almost like we are being played. I recall the previews for season 4 was just a hype, as if we are watching a day soap show. I am aware it's HBO and the politics to keep the show on the air for a long time, perhaps HBO is planning to a strategy to brake the record of the longest show on TV \"Gun Smoke\" that lasted 20 years. In a way Martell's anger for justice/revenge is kind of a reflection on us as the audience, we all want justice for the injustices and cruelty to the Starks and others we have witnessed in that past three seasons. However, like Martell's quest for justice that he waited a lifetime; we as the audience may also wait a long time, because it's not in HBO's interest to add more episode into one season. The irony here is that this show has been very clear in its theme that things never work out as we wish or expect them. So we might as well depart with those hype for justice in season 5 or the following 5 seasons because HBO will prolong and stretch this series as long as it can before \"justice\" may never prevail, as Tyrian said to Prince Obryn, \"If you have come to see justice, you have come to the wrong place\".",

Last 15 mints is the best of best ... i cannot believe Oberyn Martell died like that with smashed head and put Tyrion on sentence to death... After the Oberyn death Sansa steals the show... i cannot believe her beauty, in season 1,2,3 she was just a kid... now she is so beautiful particularly red hair. She is so beautiful. Now i am early waiting for Jaime's decision for Tyrion execution. and I wish Jon and Ygritte will unit.Best So far for Season four...",

Some viewers have expressed being turned off by the violence, but time for them to wake up, this is exactly like it happens in the book. And I for one applaud it when the show copies the book word for word, scene by scene. The final show down in this episode is exactly as it is written on the page. They speak the exact same dialog from the book too. And yes, it is shocking, yes it is violent, welcome to Game of Thrones. It's when the show departs from the book, that the quality lowers. There's been a fair few moments like that in this season. But not this episode. Good for them for not trimming any of the violence as it was in the book. It needs to be this shocking for it to work. That is what makes the scene great.There's also some incredibly good dialogs, and foreshadowing of future events in this episode. Like Arya's discussion with the Hound about the use of poison, or Littlefinger's remark how some people die on their chamberpot. The book readers are more likely to pick up on these subtle nods to things that are still to come. There's even some early foreshadowing by Prince Oberyn himself before the fight starts. It's just a very clever episode. And we still have two more epic episodes to come before this season is over.",

It's still elegant, either you see it for the first time knowing nothing or as a repetition.Like taking your armor off showing the soft parts and their inner defensive reasons, you have an intimate approach of the narrative and the characters, a human-contact literature quality experience.Simply put, I felt watching this episode, as if I was absorbed in a visual reading session: myself, the bed or the toilet, the book, and the private voyeuristic relation around the story and the characters. The attachment, the connection, the confided secret. Excellence in cinematic narrative with each piece of the stories completed in its cycle with its own essential elements. Two adjectives: very rich, very elegant.",

The Viper kills the Mountain, spear through the guts. Check. The guy is dead, and even if not dead, physiologically speaking he should be totally paralyzed and sapped of strength. You don't just get up like that after getting a spear through your guts. Your body shuts down. You can't breathe. You can barely speak. But wait! Not in Game of Thrones!! Somehow the Mountain magically comes back to life, his vocal cords all in tact with the same force and vigor even though his GUTS were just f***** up in his belly, and kills Oberyn with his bare hands!?!? Riiiiight. I think someone at the studio had a few too many drinks. No chance in hell. No, just no. Stupid and impossible. The Viper's death would only makes sense if the Mountain is some kind of magical creature rather than just a man. As far as I know, he's just a freakishly large man. For the reasons above I don't accept this episode as canon. I don't accept Oberyn's death. Now I know this show is far from \"real\"(zombies, magical creatures, etc) and maybe someone may say crazier things have happened, but deaths in this show have been pretty realistic up until now, haven't they? Oberyn should still be alive; this episode didn't happen. It was retarded (Ahh, now I know why Tyrion spoke about retards, I was wondering about that!). It was a totally impossible death scene that can only happen in the magical fairy tale universe of a retarded writer's mind.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Watchers on the Wall\" may not be the most emotionally-charged, with previous episodes with being a little more emotionally investable, episode of a consistently great to brilliant Season 4 (yes, even \"Oathkeeper\" which is not liked by some book fans) or of the penultimate-episode-of-the-season episodes. It is though the season's most thrilling, if not as epic as \"Blackwater\" from Season 2. Basically, \"The Watchers on the Wall\" depicts the battle of the Night Watchers and the Wildings. It is a truly thrilling one, full of rousing heroism, intensity and some heart-break, 'The Lord of the Rings' comparisons have been thrown around and one can see why. It was the most expensive 'Game of Thrones' episode up to this point, and that is obvious in an episode that looks expensive and has more of a cinematic look than a good deal of films with a bigger budget. In terms of individual scenes, the major scene between Jon Snow and Ygritte which was heart-breaking. The very end makes one eager for the next episode. All the performances are great, but Kit Harrington, Rose Leslie and John Bradley are especially note-worthy in the major roles most focused on.Visually, \"The Watchers on the Wall\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Watchers on the Wall\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.Concluding, wonderful episode. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

This one features the long-awaited Wildling attack on Castle Black, and it's as good as you'd expect it to be, once you get over some mildly embarrassing extraneous sentimental stuff with Sam and Gilly. The last half an hour knuckles down to a breakneck, non-stop battle filled with all manner of gory incident and brutal deaths, with numerous long-running characters being bumped off and Kit Harington excelling in the action stakes. That 360 degree tracking shot is astounding and one of the best shots in the entire run of the series.",

That isn't to say that we aren't privy to all aspects of it. John Snow is in the middle of all this. The Wildings and Ygritte are at the forefront of the invasion, and a handful of the Watch face one another. Because of a strategic advantage, they are able to parry and thrust against the overwhelming army. Soon there is carnage everywhere, but the Watch has incredible motivation. The fortress has never been conquered, but they must face the fact that a second foray would be devastating. It's hard for me to have much interest in the relationship between John and Ygritte because she is a cold blooded murderer. Even if one sees her people as victims, she doesn't hesitate to kill people who are just in the wrong place at the wrong time, even little children. This is a really well done episode because it gives us a great picture of the consequences of war. The one thing that I frequently have trouble with is identifying the two sides when they are engaged in battle. But, of course, we don't have uniforms to help us.",

Meanwhile Ygritte and Tormund fight inside Castle Black. Will Castle Black and the Wall fall to the Wildlings attack?\"The Watchers on the Wall\" is an episode that takes place in Castle Black and on the Wall only. The battle is very well developed from the initial tension of the watchers to their resistance against the Wildlings. It is good to see Ser Allister recognizing his error for not protecting the gates the way Jon Snow had suggested. The fights are brutal, with great choreography and make-up. Jon Snow's bold decision of meeting Lance might be the last chance of the Night's Watch. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"The Watchers on the Wall\"",

As the episode opens the group of Wildlings south of the wall are talking about the battle to come and Ygritte insists that she will be the one to kill Jon Snow\u0085 and will kill anybody else who tries to kill him first. At the wall Gilly arrives from Mole's Town and is let in by Sam who takes her to a secure room when the attack begins. Once the battle has started Giants sitting astride mammoths attack the gate while other Wildlings stat to scale the wall. Ygritte and her smaller group quickly scale the castle's southern wall and a battle rages within the courtyard. If the Night's Watch are to survive the must defeat this group and ensure that the gate that shuts out the northern forces remains closed.From the first season the ninth episode has been something special and this season is no exception; like the second season all the action takes place in one location; Castle Black and the area around it. The early pre-battle scenes set things up nicely and once the battle starts it is non-stop action. The action is exciting and varied; the giants on mammoths look real, there are numerous volleys of flaming arrows, exploding barrels of burning oil and thrilling scenes of close quarters combat fought with a variety of weapons. The cast did a fine job; Kit Harington was great as his character, Jon Snow, took command of the forces on top of the wall. John Bradley impressed as Sam; his character has clearly developed from the first time we saw him and it was believable to see him fighting bravely. I was saddened when Ygritte died although it was fairly inevitable and she did get a good final scene. The secondary characters impressed too; they weren't a gung-ho bunch; even the bravest were apprehensive and many of the most nervous performed when called upon\u0085 but not all. Overall this was a really exciting episode that lived up to the 'Episode Nine' reputation.",

                    "content": "Though people die damn near every episode of Game of Thrones, it is rare that it is because of a full on faction vs. faction battle. But with the Wildlings, and allies, challenging the crows, while the battle isn't as epic as the one which took place on King's Landing, it is good enough to distract you from the fact Tyrion's fate hangs in the balance.Topic 1: Those Who FallAs has long been established, there is quite a bit of fear amongst the Night's Watch when it comes to Mance Rayder and his 100,000+ army. But even with knowing of them coming for ages, they were not prepped for a two sided assault. One is led by Tormund's group and the Thenns, and the other by two giants. Tormund and co. breach the south gate as the giants, with mammoths, as well as wildlings, go to breach the wall. Alliser takes to defend the South Gate, eventually facing off with Tormund, as Janos is to command the wall.Thing is, Janos is a bleeding coward who ends up hiding along with Gilly, who found her way to Castle Black safely, so Jon is forced to take command. Which makes Janos warning Alliser of Jon's rise all the more ironic since he seemingly becomes the main reason such a rise happens. But, as Jon rises, many dead bodies fall. Ser Alliser, for one, loses his battle with Tormund, and though doesn't seem to be injured enough to be pronounced dead, he likely will be. Also, the leader of the Thenn dies, as well as the two giants; and then there is this episodes heartbreaking moment.Topic 2: Those Who Rise \u2013 Jon Snow & YgritteWith Jon's rise comes him commanding both the men on the wall, and even sending a party down to defend the tunnel from a giant. This leads to him undeniably rising in rank, especially with Alliser's health in question and Janos cowering in the basement. And while Maester Aemon is around somewhere, while his age makes him knowledgeable, as well as his talent for deciphering through BS, he cannot be the leader he needs to be. But Jon isn't the only one who steps up. Sam, oh so lovable and fluffy Sam, he steps up as well. The former buffoon of the Night's Watch, who was more studious than combat ready, finds himself a sort of hero. He saves Gilly from certain death, stays with a man as he dies, frees Jon's dire wolf, and inspires a young Ollie to join the battle. Which may make you wonder how is he a hero? Well, lest we forget, not all heroes have to be in the troughs of battle to mean something.However, while he may be a hero, in his own way, he also is the catalyst for a traumatic event. Throughout the episode Ygritte seems ready to kill as many crows as she can, including Jon. She even threatens the leader of the Thenns if he dares try to take the kill which exclusively belongs to her. So for most of the battle the two are separated and she is firing arrows left and right and thinning out the crow's defenses, then she hears Jon as he battles the Thenn's leader. She lets them battle, and as Jon claims victory in that battle, she has an arrow waiting for him. Despite this, there is a smile. For earlier in the episode Sam and Jon were just talking about love, and sex, and here is the woman who gave such a gift to Jon's memories. So even in the face of death, he finds a reason to smile. He approaches her, almost welcoming death, and then an arrow flies. Ollie kills Ygritte. With this, Jon's smile is gone and he holds his beloved and they share a moment. One in which there isn't much malice, just a woman betrayed by someone she loved, and a man who seemingly has found himself with another death of a loved one to burden his life.Topic 3: Those Who Live To Fight Another DayIn the aftermath of the battle, the crows have fend off the first assault, but with Jon knowing this is but the first assault of many, and likely just a taste of what is to come, he decides to try to cut the snake's head off by going beyond the wall to kill Mance Rayder. A task which Sam thinks is ridiculous and he asks who ordered such a thing? But, looking around, Alliser is nowhere to be seen, Janos is likely still cowering in the basement across from Gilly, and Maester Aemon would likely give Jon his blessing, so Jon decides to venture out. The odd thing though is he decides to leave his sword, and not take his wolf. Meaning that all he has is his fist, the fur on his back, and the blood of Ned Stark pumping through his veins.Things To NoteTormund is captured and is to be interrogated.Sam and Gilly kiss, and the way they kiss makes me think he may not just be this guy keeping her alive, but someone she cares for. And being how studious Sam is, he takes to studying the rules of the Night's Watch and tries to interpret the rules in such a way so that while, yes, he may not be able to have a wife of children, at least he could have a girlfriend.",

                    "content": "Maester Aemon's tales of lost love evoke a rather melancholy mood in the calm before the storm. Neill Marshall returns as the director of the excellent season 2 episode Blackwater in a 50 minute, action packed affair solely focused on the Wall. 100 men against 100 thousand, yet the Wall stands against them, and the Night's Watch, the ancient order. The 'biggest fire the North has ever seen' was a chilling sight for Jon on top of the icy Wall. Alliser Thorne redeems himself slightly with a few choice words about leadership and even a slight bit of respect for Jon's knowledge about the wildlings. They may be at each other's throats but for one night, they are brothers in the Night's Watch. His rousing speech is perhaps the most honest and passionate I have seen him and it is good the Wall still has someone of such leadership capability. His choice to defend the southern gate was admirable, and let Jon take the reigns on the Wall. He shows grit as he fights Tormund one on one and survives the encounter. Sam's character hit some new heights in the episode and he has taken a big step. With his swearing and his utmost courage in saving Gilly and defending the Wall, along with his first kiss, he is slowly becoming a man. Can't exactly say the same for Pyp with only one late kill, I will sorely miss him. It's clear they have spared no expense for this episode. The roaring mammoth was hulking and intimidating, as was the giants beside and riding it. The wilding mass of an army behind it was equally immense, and as the giant arrow smashed into a Night's Watch member, it looked grim for the NW. The scene where the giants utilise the mammoth to pull down the gate was very impressive in it's own right and it's good to see CGI being put to good use. Grenn takes a massive step as he is given the gate to hold against much bigger foes. The tunnel scene is very well crafted. The scared crow next to Grenn shows some genuine fear and Grenn steals the scene as together they recite their vows in the face of a charging giant. I got chills from every line of the vow. Ygritte provides a different sort of badass with her standing up to the Magnar of Thenn and her exceptional archery skills which proved the untimely end of Pyp. It's an ultimately tragic end for her as the wilding who loved Jon for the person he is, not the crow. I was disappointed they chose to go for the boy archer end given how obvious the foreshadowing is but the final lines between Ygritte and Jon were heartbreaking and perfect in recounting their story. That stare as she refused to release the arrow...Technically, the visual effects were spectacular. From the giants and the mammoths, the fiery explosive barrels, Ghost ripping into wilding flesh, the massive scythe dragging across the icy surface ...Jon's final fight with the Magnar of Thenn was brutal and showcase every bit of fighting skills from both. The shooting of Tormund reminded me briefly of Indiana Jones as well but I'm glad they have him as a captive. Fleshed out characters like him are hard to come by. The final words are telling. It was only a test from Mance Rayder. There is more coming for the Night's Watch, and they stand little chance without Jon's involvement. Is anyone in the seven kingdoms noticing this? Find out next week in what will be a jaw dropping finale. 9/10I'm predicting a perfect 10 for next week.",

Not only is it even more engaging, but the action sequences that take place in the Wall is beyond amazing and has some great character interactions between Jon Snow and the other men in the Wall. I have absolutely no problem with this episode because everything is done perfectly.The storyline/script is still well-written, the performances are still compelling especially with Kit Harington who interacts with the other members of the Wall in the satisfying battle sequence, the dialog is fresh, the pacing is solid, the directing and editing is even more sharper, the characters are still believable, the music score from Ramin Djawadi suited the battle sequence really well with atmosphere and emotion, the costumes are great, and the scenery and sets are still lavish. So, overall, another epic episode for Season 4 and sets up the last episode nicely. :)",

Some scenes are particularly sad and heartfelt and captures its dramatic and melancholic essence so well. The battle between the Men of the Night's Watch and the Wildlings is utterly superb, seriously its own level of awesome. If you thought Blackwater was great, which it is, then this is just as good if not better. Acting is solid and there are some great scenes with chemistry between Sam and Jon, Jon and Ygritte, etc. Ollie has to ruin everything the idiot. This might be my joint favourite episode of the season and it's in my top ten Game of Thrones episodes. Ever. Jon Snow truly shines and stands out as the best in this one, heroic and strong. Up until this episode alone, this is a top five in the series. You gotta see it, even just for the last 20-25 minutes alone because it's bewildering entertainment. Truly epic.",

The scale at which the episode is filmed is of epic proportions; Peter Jackson would have been proud. There are some flaws but those flaws cant be avoided when filming fight scenes involving many men. It is really a character driven episode because somehow you get the feeling that you wont be seeing some of these characters alive again.

With how this show has been about not being shy about killing off anyone, it really makes it so intense in that you feel any and all the characters are really in danger. The battle lasts for the majority of the episode and doesn't slow up from the time it begins, until it ends.This episode has some of the most amazing visuals and sets so far on Game of thrones. With all of the giants and creatures we have been teased with, you really get to see all of it this episode. It has a long continuous shot towards the end of the battle which was pretty awesome as well. The finale next Sunday should finish off, in my opinion, the best season yet.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Children\" is for me alongside \"The Lion and the Rose\" and \"The Laws of Gods and Men\", one of the best episodes of a consistently great to brilliant Season 4 (yes, even \"Oathkeeper\" which is not liked by some book fans). It is also one of the best 'Games of Thrones' season finales, whereas a couple of the season finales have been cases of the penultimate episodes making more of an impression (Season 3 being especially notable in this regard) and one of the show's most thrilling, in drama and action, episodes. Action-wise, \"The Children\" rouses and excites in its intensity and its insane physical action dexterity, The Hound fight especially. \"The Children\" not just an action-packed episode. It is very much emotionally charged all the way through, with a lot of intimate character development, plot advancements, introduction of new ideas that one cannot wait to be developed and unexpected twists. Constantly, the acting cannot be faulted. It is not an exception with \"The Children\". Peter Dinklage, Kit Harrington and Charles Dance are standouts.Visually, \"The Children\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Children\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions such as suspenseful tension, poignant pathos and witty humour. The story is paced beautifully, structured with such nuance and attention to coherence, a high emotional level and is done with intelligence, passion and sensitivity.All in all, barnstorming season finale. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Certainly from this point on there would be fantastic episodes - even better than those which have come previously - but also more filler each and every series. THE CHILDREN ties together neatly all the plotlines of the show. Tyrion's final scenes with Tywin are well remembered for good reason, but there's an epic and brutal bout between the Hound and Brienne before then, along with a great JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS-inspired set-piece north of the wall. Jon seems suddenly full of gravitas and maturity and any episode featuring Ciaran Hinds is a winner.",

Arya's character is getting stronger and stronger. We apparently say goodbye to the Hound. Is she showing compassion for him, or is she allowing him to die a painful death. John Snow goes on a quest to kill the leader of the Wildings, but due to the convenient arrival of thousands of soldiers, he sees his mission unnecessary. He is also able to say goodbye to Ygritte (although I don't understand why she is so special). Then, there is the fate of Tyrion. I waited the whole episode wondering what would happen (I was afraid that would have to wait until the next season). Anyway, the final ten minutes do incredible justice to the viewers. We are now set up for another powerful season. Dany continues to be (for me) the most boring of all the characters. I know some felt sad when she shackled the dragons. I wonder if she really knows what she's doing.",

Jon asks for mercy for Mance to Stannis since he was well treated by him when he was his prisoner. Tywin wants to force Cersei to marry Loras and they have an argument. Cersei discloses her affair to her father and tells that she will make it public if he insists in marrying her. Jaime and Lord Varys help Tyrion to escape, but he kills Shae that is in Tywin's bed with his hands and his father with a crossbow. Then he leaves king's Landing with Varys in a ship. Daenerys learns that her black dragon killed a three year-old girl and she locks them up in the dungeons. Brienne and Pod meet Arya and The Hound and Brienne has a deadly sword fight with The Hound to keep Arya. Bran, Jojen, his sister and Hodo reach their target but they are attacked by Wights. \"The Children\" is a grand finale for a great season of Game of Thrones. The story is becoming mystic, with the Wights in the North; Stannis with Melisandre; Bran and his encounter with the three-eyed raven; Arya heading to Braavos. Jon Snow has a gentle attitude toward Mance and his farewell to Ygritte shows how much he loved her. The fighting between Brienne and The Hound is quite pointless and next year we fans will finally know Braavos. Fortunately Tyrion has survived and the great surprise is to know that Lord Varys has helped him. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"The Children\"",

                    "content": "If there was a time when this show wasn't mainstream then it seems a very long time ago since this fourth season arrived with a lot of fuss and excitement. This excitement came of course from the internet as it had always done, but also from the newspapers and other regular outputs which would normally be more concerned with the goings-on of the soaps. The increase in popularity is a good thing in many ways, but it is not a great surprise since, once you get beyond the mythology, swords, dragons and nudity, Game of Thrones is ultimately a grownup soap opera with lots of twists and turns, and plenty of colour to talk about the next day at work.That is a little unfair in a season that seems a bit more assured in the telling of the story and, although violence and nudity of course remain, the show seems to be using them less to draw in curious viewers. Particularly this applies to the nudity, which is noticeably reduced and applied to smaller roles than in previous seasons. The focus here is very much on the telling of the story, and this is as it should be as the show now has more and more plates spinning than ever, and a lot more big plot developments to go with it. As with before, I was impressed by how well it moves through the plotting \u2013 delivering a lot with short scenes but also knowing when to take longer to build tension in a specific scene or to let things play out a little slower. There are many impacting and memorable moments in this season and they are all well- delivered; despite the pace of delivery, it never becomes \"then this happens, then that happens etc\".That said, this season perhaps doesn't totally keep it as tight and effective as other seasons. Wherever the scene is focused will be very well done, but I was surprised by how little time was spent with some characters and also how infrequently we saw some of them. In several cases, narrative threads that had me engaged, just seemed to drop off the radar for many episodes, or in some cases were not returned to this season. In the moment this didn't bother me, but after the episodes and after the season finished, I did realize that quite some aspects had not moved forward much or had been left hanging. It is a minor complaint though, mainly because it is entirely understandable that not everything can be fitted in even when it comes to the main narrative. As always, the budget is well used to get good costumes, sets and special effects (although perhaps sparingly used of course). The performances are easy to dismiss because of the rather schlocky nature of the material at times, however this is to do it a disservice because everyone makes good on their characters and finds smaller moments to do very good work with very little. The fourth season has a lot going on and the standard of story-telling remains high. Understandably it perhaps loses touch with some characters or threads more than it would like to, but in the moment it is great and in the bigger picture it remains engaging and entertaining.",

He then proceeds to Mance Rayder's camp; he doesn't expect to survive this mission but as he and Mance talk they are both surprised when a large force attacks from the south; the army of Stannis Baratheon. Further north Bran reaches his destination but not before one of his party is lost to White Walkers. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys is having more problems ruling in Meereen; some of the older freed slaves want to return to their masters and one of her dragons has departed and killed more than a few sheep forcing her to chain the remaining two. Near the Eyrie Brienne and Prodrick meet Arya and The Hound; a meeting that leaves Arya alone again with one less name on her list. Back in King's Landing Cersei tells her father that the rumours about her and Jaime are all true and Jamie helps Tyrion escape. As he flees he has a surprising encounter in his father's bedchamber followed by one final confrontation with his father before Lord Varys spirits him onto a boat to safety. Finally we return to Arya as she boards a ship to Braavos, having shown the captain the coin given her by Jaqen H'ghar.After the excitement of the previous episode one might be forgiven for expecting a more average episode\u0085 this might not have featured thirty minutes of non-stop action but it was still thrilling and managed to kill of a surprising number of fairly major characters. The story is told at a cracking pace and we catch up with most key characters as they reach a turning point in their plot arc or die. The opening scenes where Stannis's army defeat Mance's forces are perhaps the weakest of the episode as the timing is just a little too perfect; still it looked impressive and occurred in a way that meant both Jon and Mance survive to go into season five. The end of Bran's journey gave us an impressive little fight as the party had to battle skeletal White Walkers who rose from the ground around them; it also raised questions about what will happen next for him. Daenerys's scene where she chained her dragons was short but poignant. More excitement came when Brienne fought The Hound; an thrilling sword fight where the result was far from obvious\u0085 this led to a great scene between Maisie Williams and Rory McCann as Arya has one last conversation with the dying hound which shows just how hardened Arya has become. We get two great scenes from Charles Dance as Tywin Lannister; the first as Lena Headey's Cersei tells him of her incestuous relationship with her brother and then when he has his last conversation with Peter Dinklage's Tyrion\u0085 Tywin was a great character and will be missed. This all served to bring season four to a fine conclusion; I can't wait to see season five!",

This is one of those rare times I'm actually on Cercei's side and even sympathize with her as we see how Twin see's her not as a daughter to love and respect but as a tool for his own means. Cercei refuses to bend toward Tywin's orders, because not just does it go against her own desires but their just an excuse for Tywin to control and manipulate her son the recent King of the Iron Throne. That speech Cercei gives was just great when she says one of my favorite quotes \"I will burn a house to the ground.\" Some people think it's strange Tywin didn't know about the relationship between Cercei and Jaime. But it's not hard to believe when you think about it because Tywin has always been self centered and wrapped up in the business of power that he's hardly had time or even attempted to make the time to know a little about his own children. At that moment when Cercei announced that, I saw the look on Tywin's face and that was a sign that power is slipping away from his fingers.However it all comes down to the those final minutes which are both tragic and triumphant. We see Tyron is making his escape, really liked a little of that last interaction with his brother Jamie which was kinda sad because due to circumstances both may never see each other again but it also signified that Jamie is his true family.But as Tyron makes his escape he then gets a rude awakening and so do we when he comes to Tywin's chamber, there is a woman that sounds familiar. We then find out who that woman is and it's Shae. I'll admit it was really heart sinking as we see how far the betrayal went. Some say she was forced into betraying Tyron but I'm not so sure, as she was sleeping she was saying \"Tywin, my lion.\" that was the very thing she always called Tyron, which just twisted the screw of betrayal even more; it made me wonder if the betrayal began from the very beginning, was most of what Shae said to Tyron a lie. We may never really know which makes it all the more painful for Tyron and us.We then see after Shae meets her fate (which is something Tyron regrets) he is just pushed over the edge and takes a crossbow to assassinated his father. We see Tyron finds Tywin in the lavadore, so Tywin has been caught with his pants down literally. At that point I know Tywin can't manipulate his way out of this one. Tywin may'be a master manipulator but he's no chess master; he can manipulate pieces to go where he wants them to go but he can't really anticipate nor see possible outcomes or scenarios. Let alone he's forgotten the most important rules in the game, never underestimate your opponent and people aren't chess pieces.I never did like Tywin because not just is he a complete blowhole but simply how he regards and treats his kids as nothing more than chess pieces to win. What is even worse is how he sees Tyron as nothing but worthless, and that trial just gave him the excuse to do what he always wanted regardless of the law and the truth. But Tywin was wrong dead wrong, Tyron isn't worthless he's more man than he ever was. It's kinda poetic justice as we see Tywin get nailed in the lavadore, you can say he died on the throne he deserved. So, this is another grave I gladly dance upon.Where ever Tyron, Sonsa, Aya, Brian, and Snow go I wish theme well. So a few players in this game are no longer with us but the game continues, let us hope one or all of them win.Rating: 4 stars",

                    "content": "After so many beloved characters dying this season, it makes even the series changing one which comes in the finale something which you hunch your shoulders at. But, with us getting in touch with most of the major forces of the show, you can see that one death means a dramatic shift in what is to come. Otherwise, most of the episode seems like any other, which is making me think that television shows are foregoing cliffhangers and big time season finales. Which I'm not sure if that is a good thing or bad thing.Topic 1: It Is Over Just Before It Begun \u2013 Jon Snow, Stannis, and DaenerysJust as you think Jon Snow is to be the hero who kept Mance Rayder and those of the north from crossing the wall, in comes Stannis Baratheon. With Melisandre's prediction coming true, Stannis finds himself becoming the savior of the north as his men march through Mance's camp and massacre quite a bit of Mance's allies. Even with this defeat though, Mance refuses to kneel. After all, you don't becoming King of the North, the one who united of all those varying factions, without staring death in the face a few times. But, luckily for Mance, Jon Snow announces his relation to Ned Stark and Stannis seeks his council on what to do with Mance. And since Mance truly seems to be a man who simply wants to lead his followers past the walls and into safety, and treated Jon rather kindly, he asks Mance to be spared, something Stannis seems willing to do for now. Also, such a gift is given to Tormund as well.As for Daenerys, she learns a revolution can't be done in one false swoop. For while freeing the slaves has made the younger generation grateful, it has left the old vulnerable. For while she seems to have created some sort of safety net for the newly free, the youth run control and exploit these safe havens. Showing that while she maybe queen, governing is certainly not one of her talents. Still, her sole issue isn't just trying to figure out how to handle these new slaves lack of employment, which is given the band aid of letting former slaves make yearlong contracts, but there is also the issue of her dragons. As we have seen, the mother of dragons has no control over her babies. They are wild and untamed, visibly independent of her will, and now not only killing livestock, but also people. And with Daenerys being shows the corpse of a three year old girl killed by her dragons, she decides it is better to seal them than let them be free. But, she only finds two of her dragons, with perhaps the most fearsome left to menace her kingdom.Topic 2: All is Revealed \u2013 Bron & CerseiBron has finally reached the place of his dreams, but like with all dreams which come to reality for characters on this show, a sacrifice is required. For Bron, this means losing Jojen to these odd skeletal creatures. But, in return for his sacrifice he meets what are known as \"The Children,\" which are nymph like creatures that look inspired by Jim Henson's work in the 1980s. Most importantly however, he meets their leader who seems to have grand plans for Bron. Which, sadly, aren't detailed past him perhaps getting wings.Leading us to speak on Cersei. Once again, Cersei begs her father Tywin to not force her into marrying Loras. But, as always, the patriarchal structure of the Game of Thrones world makes her attempts to assert herself seem to be in vain. So, in order to fight back, she decides to threaten Tommen's life, as well as her own, in order to keep herself from having to marry Loras. Though perhaps she presents no bigger threat to Tywin than revealing her relations with Jamie. Yes, you heard it, she admits to incest and this leaves Tywin utterly speechless. Though considering how blonde Robert's would-be kids are, he has to have known, never mind the rumors. Either way, with this confession Cersei decides to cast her cares to the wind and openly have sex with Jamie and have their relationship be almost public.Topic 3: In Memoriam \u2013 Arya & TyrionAfter Arya just missing Sansa, she finds herself found by Brienne. Something which is a bit unsettling for Brienne's look screams Lannister lackey. So, being that The Hound is protective of Arya, he faces off with Brienne who goes Xenon Warrior Princess on him and wins. However, during this fight she loses sight of Arya, who is in hiding. Then, when Arya comes out to see The Hound, who clearly is going to die after the beating he took, he asks for mercy. But Arya doesn't grant this to him, she even doesn't kill him when The Hound mentions how he should have raped Sansa when he had the chance. All Arya does is steal his coins and then buys her way onto a ship bound for Braavos.Leaving us with Tyrion. The night before his execution Jamie frees him, but rather than run as quickly as his legs could allow, he lingers. What he finds first is Shae, seemingly in his father's bed, and they fight and when you think they may make up and make love, what happens is he strangles her to death. Then he grabs a crossbow and confronts Tywin. There is banter back and forth, nothing too friendly, and when Tyrion gets sick of his father underestimating and insulting him, two arrows are shot into Tywin and he dies. Leading Tyrion to strangely go to Lord Varys to hide him, which he does, and the season ends with Tyrion off to hide in exile as the bell tolls to announce the death of Tywin.",

                    "content": "This was the finale we had all been waiting for. The showrunners called it the best hour of television they had ever made, so I went in with high expectations. The aftermath of the Castle Black assault is ominous in its scenery as Jon reaches out to Mance to strike a bargain. I found Mance's portrayal a bit lacking of that earlier season grimace and fear he commanded; here he sounded a lot less menacing and intimidating, even talking about his own death. Still, the entire sequence of the cavalry arriving was epic. The music was fitting as Stannis' army, more disciplined, more organised, surrounded the band of wildlings and came away with a overwhelming victory. A comical moment as a solitary wildling was mowed down in front of Stannis set the tone for a interesting balance between the unyielding King beyond the Wall and the One True King, Stannis Baratheon. A warning from Jon is foreboding; there is harsher and more terrible horrors out there in the north which makes for burning bodies a wise idea.Pycelle continues his incompetence as Grand Maester yet Qyburn is there to fill his shoes. Cersei seems very interested in the fate of her Mountain of a warrior but in contrast is adamant of her position in King's Landing. Cersei finally takes control over her father's meddling ways and drops the incest bombshell on Tywin to devastating effect. It's a conflicting Tywin, head of the Lannister house who cannot control his family like he has done so for so long. All 3 of his children now in open rebellion. And two of them continue their inseparable bond. Moving over to Essos, Dany's actions finally come back to bite her. She's been unstoppable and invincible, but the consequences of her breaking chains shows in Hazzea's story of the safety of slavery. Freedom seems to be not everyone's goal. What is even more damning is the second coming of Drogon unchained, now feeding not on mere sheep, but children. Dany makes the decision to chain up her remaining two dragons in hope of preventing this. It's a heartbreaking scene as she locks away her 'children' and show signs of wear and despair, her campaign finally starting to show some signs of unravelling. His name was Grenn, giant-slayer, and he held the gate. His name was Pyp, steward. The burning is an emotional scene as we say goodbye to two friends of Jon Snow. The awkwardness of the outsiders in Stannis and Davos is fitting yet you sense Mel is finally able to show her true colours after the success of the cavalry charge, which she advised way back in the season 2 finale. Touching words by Tormund lead to Jon bringing Ygritte back North to her true home and burning her alone. In front of the Weirwood Tree, she is kissed by fire. Another notable Weirwood Tree finally makes its appearance in a scene we have been waiting for forever. The Three Eyed Raven's cave is so close yet in a stunning sequence of events, undead wights rise from the ground in an ambush. It's purely CHI and a spectacle to behold as we finally witness Bran take full control of Hodor and utilise his warging potential. The death of Jojen was quite unnecessary I felt, but it magnified the desperation of the situation and the first COTF sighting. Not exactly what I had in mind but the fireballs sure are handy. Leading them into the cave to finally meet the Raven is a tense reveal; the man in the roots emanates power and presence. Time to fly, Brandon Stark. We had predicted a Brienne and Hound meeting but not like this. Two heavyweights clashed in a verbal battle emphasising just how much the Hound cares for Arya before a swordfight erupts. It's brutally choreographed to go from grabbing bare Valyrian steel to biting off ears but it ends with the Hound ultimately falling. Arya's transformation is clear and the Hound's jibes of Mycah and Sansa are cutting and damning. As cold as she has become, her walk away is colder. Shae's reveal was so shocking and yet the fight scene was not what I had in mind. It becomes much less tragic the relationship they had if Tyrion kills her only in self defense. Yet the next scene made up for it. Gone is the jovial half man full of wit. The father son talk is perfect for Father's Day, chilling and cutting to each other's pride. Tywin's lifelong hatred is so evident even with his declaration of Tyrion as his son and as a Lannister. He despised Tyrion's whoring yet take pleasure in Shae himself. And so ends Tywin Lannister, the man who cared so much about his family but failed to care about his children. You shot me, he said, surprised. The final scene was not what I wanted but still a great cliffhanger. Arya finally finds her true calling and utters the words that ring true in this show: Valar Morghulis. All men must die. And yet some live to see another day. Bring on Season 5. 9.5/10 (Book readers will know why this is not a perfect 10)",

There's nothing I have to fault this episode since I have so much to praise about it.The storyline/script continues to be well-written, the performances are great and makes the characters even more relatable including Tyrion, Sansa, and Arya who set off on separate paths to different directions to see what's in store for them. The directing and editing are smooth, the pacing, once again, never drags and the relationships continue to be interesting. The scenery, sets, and costumes are still fabulous and the music score from Ramin Djawadi continues to be beautiful.The scene where Arya leaves the Hound to die after he got wounded was nice since in the previous episodes, they started to bond with another, but it doesn't change the fact that they're different people since the Hound was a complete jerk to her and Arya wanted revenge on King Joffrey for what happened to her father. So, Arya heading off on her own was really cool.So, overall, another masterpiece of an episode and a great set-up for the fifth season. :)",

                    "content": "This episode hurt to finish up because I've come to love the TV show and the books with an immense passion. This review may contain spoilers from the book as well.I feel like I've been reserving all judgment for the entire season as a whole, hinging solely upon my expectation from the last few minutes of the finale. And since they left out Stoneheart, I can more definitely say that overall this has been the blandest season yet---everything felt incredibly condensed, small-scale, or otherwise stripped of much of its importance and/or eloquence.I also realize for the first time that the dialogue has deviated almost completely from the books. I hadn't realized when I audiobooked the first one how so many of the lines from season 1 were straight from the book. Less so in season 2. By season 3, most of the dialogue was completely original. And yet enough time was given for everything to breathe and resonate.In season 4, the dialogue feels like a cliff-notes version of what the actual dialogue was supposed to be. Everything felt rushed, as if by the end of Joffrey's wedding, they were picking up speed and sprinting for the finish. And then they... just stop short of the actual finish. What was the rush? What could they possibly have been saving up for, especially when they couldn't even cram that anti-climax of an ep10 open into a spectacular climax for the previous episode?And this sort of condensing suffers even worse by having so many of the colorful \"flavor\" bits removed---the rhyme-game Reek plays constantly \"Reek, Reek, rhymes with -eek\", \"Only Cat\", any sort of flavor or humor from Tormund Giantsbane, anything even remotely interesting beyond exposition from Meera and Jojen Reed, bits of lines from songs like \"Hands of Gold\" or \"The Dornishman's Wife\" or \"The Last of the Giants\", anything to justify Edd being Dolorous Edd beyond just \"other guy from Night's Watch\"All of it was removed and replaced with... nothing. I didn't complain all the way back in seasons 2-3 when it was noted that the show had basically stripped all personality out of side characters like Edd and Tormund, because I figure they would eventually play in to their more fruitful roles when they had more time and weren't constantly busy (like in A Feast for Crows). I still hold out hope for this with Tormund and Edd, but season 4 has made that just all the more noticeable in its absence, and the finale has utterly broken any and all trust I had in the show creators NOT in \"faithfully adapting\" the book, but in making it their own in such a way that it could have some fun on its own and retain some actual drama from the books.Literally everything in this episode felt immensely padded and simultaneously rushed, that by the time Tyrion was confronting Tywin, I thought there was no way any more than 40-45 minutes could have passed by now. Even then the scene was done in 4 or 5 minutes and left a sour taste by its lack of potential.That pretty much sums up the entire finale: lack of potential, could have been more, just enough, average effort Even leaving out the absence of Lady Stoneheart, what exactly about this episode was supposed to \"blow my mind\"? Everything was set up, happened, then brushed away, with a stunning scarcity in musical cues at key moments that pretty much ruined much of the potential drama. I found the \"fight\" Shae put up with Tyrion to be absurd, and it utterly killed any and all shock/horror/heartbreak from that scene. Dinklage almost saved it with his facial expressions immediately after, but the whole straightforward-ness of the entire scene, and the bland earnest-ness of Jaime to just release his brother \"because he's my brother, dude\" fell horribly flat to me.The lack of mention of Tysha wasn't a big deal on its own---it became a big deal in its absence by being compounded with the apparently half-assed effort put into the encounter with Shae and everything leading up to it. It became all \"daddy issues\" instead of \"daddy oh my gods you are psychotic you've ruined literally every single good thing in my life\" I can't believe it but the only thing about this season that worked was everything involving Oberyn Martell, Sandor Clegane and Arya, and the battle at the Wall. That battle was seriously mind-blowing in its relentless music, scale, diversity of going on, and the dismal realization for pretty much anyone that \"This is going to keep going until we are ground to dust and given how main characters in this show aren't safe, there's a high probability that Mance Rayder could take the wall, then tell all the kings in the south 'I am King of the Wall, now send help against White Walkers or we'll invade you'\" The first two-three seasons actually felt like a labor of love. Season 4 doesn't. And I look back now at that statement the showmakers made that the Red Wedding was what made them want to make the series to begin with, and if the show survived just long enough to depict that, they'd be happy. In retrospect, it feels like they got that and were happy, but now they're not happy anymore and don't care about putting forth the maximum effort.I'm not even the type to whine and complain about any such work doing this, but it struck me here as just so patently obvious... like they had to make a conscious effort to fail as hard as they did with this finale. Even without Stoneheart, they had the pieces there to make it one of the greatest finales of the series (not the greatest) but they rushed their sole remaining wham-moment so badly that it barely registered as much as it could have.",

                    "content": "I am currently in a state of shock. Another series that I have loved was ruined by poor script that was probably written by someone who has been working on action movies of the B - or rather F - class. I had to downgrade my earlier evaluation of the series down another notch as well because the last episode of 4th season was so bad. 7/10 is still a good grade, but considering that 1st season was 10/10 material, well...Action/Fighting scenes added no value to the series and truth be told, one of them was executed in a manner that suggested lack of funding or lack of skill in the special effects department. We have seen better quality special effects in movies and series produced 30-40 years ago. Computers were supposed to help to maintain the illusion that we are in a fantasy world, but then we have explosions and animated monsters that look very much computer generated and unlike the previous monsters shown in the show. We have already seen better animated monsters and explosions in the earlier seasons, one can only ask why? Why add such scene at all, if it is done so poorly.Then there was logic that was thrown out of the window. Two characters end up fighting against each other for no reason at all - in the classic mano-a-mano fashion that action film industry is so famous of. After the fight (which would have resulted in two dead/dying people in reality) is all over, the winning character just exits the scene with the lamest excuse of all time. Not sticking around to even check what became of the enemy. Sigh. Nor the \"motive\" for the fight.And about that duel/fist fight. When we try to kid ourselves to believe that this is a mystical land of fantasy, it does not help if the show's producers decide to forget all that has been shown in the show before. Why is Valyrian steel so valued in the Westeros? Because of its ability to cut through steel armor? No, after this episode, we know that such sword is so blunt that the blade can be held at bay by bare hands. The producers waste several minutes in these two action scenes that they have little time to actually introduce meaningful scenes that would explain why (for example) Tyrion does what he does in the episode. If I had not read the books, I would have been completely at loss with the scene. My son - who has not read the books - almost stormed out in middle of the episode - because he felt that the episode and especially its action sequences were so stupid. My other son, who has read the books, did leave the room for a while because he had to calm himself down. He felt this episode did such injustice to the written story that he no longer wished to watch the series.Strange to say - some of the acting in this episode was the poorest I've seen so far. Perhaps you would shed a tear or two when your one true love or two of your best friends die, but well, I could be wrong. Looking constantly as if you'd been hit with a log in the head is not acting. It should be reserved for Sylvester Stallone / Russell Crowe (in Gladiator) who know no other facial expressions. I am trying to recover from the shock and hopefully will return for season 5, but it better have better script, special effects and well... even acting. If not, then I certainly understand how Hollywood kills its best shows. They add more action/chase sequences and pretend that this is what the audience wants. When the audience exits, they kill the show and keep wondering what went wrong.",

                    "content": "Well season four finally ended, what an episode it was that packed all the things we have been waiting for into one episode. If you really think about this whole season you can probably add these ten episodes as maybe five decent ones, the rest just went no where wasted on characters like \"Sam and Gilie\" which really do not serve the story line. I knew the Stannis' army was going to show up to help Brother's of the night's watch at Castle Black; since they were warned about this attack in the end of last season but the producers kept that for surprise for the last episode; to pack an action pack beginning. What followed with the fight between Brienne and Hound which was another brilliant choreographed fight was to add more thrills and yet there was an article today posted about the fight not being true to what is in the book?. I guess the big shock for me was Tyrion finding Shae naked in his father's bed; his hurt was written all over his face, especially when he heard her call his father's name by name. Tywin Lannister's death by Tyrion is something I had predicted; even though I have never read the books but Tyrion was only son that stood up to his father and spoke up about his methods; that's why probably why his father hated him for his arrogance and defiance about the truth. It was some ironic poet justice to be killed by the very person whom Tywin hated and wanted to kill for so long. Tywin Lannister was the epitome of evil; with all his self serving justification but a coward who had no sense of honor and integrity so it was justice well served by Tyrion. The weird scenes, almost like a comical sequel was to see \"Gregor\" to be still alive?!.I really wonder if that was really in the book because the Hound never fought Brienne in the book, so is Gregor going to be rebuilt as a new creature?. I already expressed this in my last post here, I am very disappointing in both the producers \"David Benioff and D.B. Weiss\" and HBO who are just dragging and toying with the audience to drag this show out with filler and fluff . These two past seasons basically moved at an ant's pace with irrelevant scenes focused on irrelevant characters like \" Samwell Tarly\" of brother's of the night watch who has had more screen time in the past two season's than the main characters of this show like Arya Stark or her brother Brandon. This is a marketing game these people are playing and trust me come March 2015 where you see promos of Season 5 where David Benioff will make up more hype about season 5 to be the best of it all; even though we are all hooked already no matter how bad the show gets. I love the last scene of this last episode when Arya is finally going to Braavos to find \"Valar Morghulis\", something that was also hinted in the last episode of last season 3, something that was ignored this entire season, but what surprised me was when she asked the ship's captain that she wanted to go to the North to the Wall first?!..perhaps to find her brother Jon Snow, but her character's goal seems to be more rooted on revenge than finding family in this season. It was a great ending, the first time you saw Arya completely free to pursue her own calling, I predict her meeting with the strange enigmatic man whom gave her the coin (Valar Morghulis) is where the big change may come, but with this show nothing is for certain. When you see Arya walking to the front of the ship and looking away, last shot of ship sailing away was a great metaphor as her journey is really just beginning!",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Wars to Come\", while not living up to the previous season's finale \"The Children\", is a very promising start for Season 5. It is not the most dramatic, action-packed, story-advancing or most emotion-filled of episodes, instead going the slower, more reflective and intimate approach. This is not a problem because, although some may disagree, 'Game of Thrones' has shown numerous times that it does these types of episodes excellently. Some characters are better developed than others, Tyrion continues to have plenty of meat to him and is getting more fascinating with each episode. Am also really appreciating Cersei getting more development and becoming more prominent. Sansa is rather bland though.The episode does a great job beginning where the previous season left off, reminding us of what happened and sets things up for what is to follow. There is not a massive amount in terms of character progression however, though it's certainly evident if not quite deep enough, and other episodes have done better in moving things forward.'Game of Thrones' has always been strong when it comes to acting and \"The Wars to Come\" is not an exception. Peter Dinklage can do no wrong, he is a fan favourite for great reason, and Lena Headey, Aidan Gillen and Emilia Clarke also do a huge amount with their characters.Visually, \"The Wars to Come\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Wars to Come\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, even with the quieter and slower approach to the storytelling, and has enough passion and sensitivity. Overall, promising start to Season 5. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

I don't think the flashback at the start is a good idea, but the rest works very well. The scenes at Castle Black are particularly good when focusing on the new dynamics between Jon, Stannis, Alliser and Mance, and the new threat in Meereen has plenty of potential.",

                    "content": "This, the first episode of the firth series opens with two young girls walking through the woods to a small shack where they find a woman; one of the girls demands that the woman tell her what will happen in her future. She is told that she will marry the king and have three children who will wear golden crowns and golden shrouds. It then becomes apparent that the girl was Cersei Lannister and she was recalling past events. With her powerful father dead she is certain that the family's enemies are just waiting for the right time to move against them.Across the Narrow Sea Tyrion and Varys have reached Pentos; Varys still believes that Tyrion will have an important role ensuring that the right person ends up on the Iron Throne but Tyrion is just keen to be drunk. In Meereen things aren't going according to plan for Daenerys; one of the unsullied has been murdered while visiting a brothel and she is being petitioned to reopen the fighting pits where combatants would fight to the death; something she finds intrinsically offensive. If that weren't enough her dragons are growing even bigger and don't appear to be controllable.At Castle Black Stannis asks Jon to persuade Mance Rayder to bend his knee and join his forces; Jon is convinced that Mance would rather die than bend his knee. Elsewhere Sansa and Lord Baelish are heading to somewhere far from the capital and Brienne is trying to get Pod to stop travelling with her.While this wasn't as exciting as the previous episode it is still pretty solid; inevitably some time is spent reminding us what has been happening to some, but by no means all, the major characters. It also hints at many things to come; notably introducing a group known as the 'Sons of the Harpy'; a group opposed to Daenerys's rule, another religious group in King's Landing and having Stannis tell us of his plans to liberate the north then the rest of Westeros. This was all fairly interesting even though there wasn't much in the way of action. That isn't to say there was no action; the final scene showing Mance's execution was impressive as was the sight of the dragons, which have grown considerable since we last saw them. As expected the cast do a fine job; Peter Dinklage and Conleth Hill impressed in there scene together as Tyrion and Varys and Ciar\u00e1n Hinds does a fine job depicting Mance Rayder as he prepares for his unpleasant death\u0085 he is a character who will be missed. Overall this episode got the fifth season off to a decent start; I look forward to seeing the rest of the season.",

It served as a nice bridge from season 4's epic finale to the inevitably crazy season 5. Luckily we got at least one scene with every major character, as the first episode of each season usually does, so I immediately felt like Game of Thrones never left.We began tonight with our first true flashback sequence involving Cersei. From what I hear this season will have plenty more flashbacks so I look forward to possibly seeing old characters come back or just younger version of characters who we already know. We did see one last glimpse of Tywin, who lays dead with fake eye balls. I found it fitting that they went right from that scene to Tyrion's eyes looking through the box on the ship. Tyrion is liking going down a darker path this year, but knowing there's a possibility of him meeting up with Daenerys is all the more intriguing. Speaking of her, not sure how much I like the relationship with Naharis as i'm definitely missing Jorah's presence.Jon Snow is having a rough time dealing with his new life with the 'King's presence and Melisandre's increasingly creepy seductiveness. The death of Rayder clearly had an impact on him and I can definitely see conflict rising between Snow and Baratheon in the future. Brienne gave us a good short scene where yet again we have a close encounter with a Stark. I haven't read the books but can there really be this many 'almost' meetings between characters who are looking for each other? Daenerys tried to 'tame' her dragons at the end, and it sure seemed like this wont be the end of that particular conflict. From the trailers alone we see her dragons disobeying her so we may finally get the dragon violence and action that everyone has been craving. So tonight's episode did just about everything right in it's hope to build the tension with all the characters and future story lines. Let the wars begin.+Tyrion meeting Daenerys? +Enter the dragons +Feel the tension +Brienne is always BA -Close encounters -Naharis 8.6/10",

But I must speak up, give credit where credit is also due.Much of my contributions for IMDb is usually before having seen the entire episode, and I noticed that other reviewer going \"disappointing start, nothing significant happens\" and at about midway, I kinda saw it was down from the previous season, thought this bit of me having jumped (however belatedly) onto the GAME OF THRONES bandwagon, full fury and throng, well, now it's past the apex anyway, like other reviewers say, bah...Fortunately though, turns out, not the case...This show does something IMMENSELY right. Look, I'm here for the actresses. I joined up for the beauty of Emilia Clarke. GAME OF THRONES was suggested to me by a friend who showed me a sneak preview in the knowledge I'd flip my lid. You get the picture, I'm sure you do.But I've recently had one of my few deviations in my reviews when I praised Peter Dinklage's performance in that episode last season, his confrontation in court with Tywin. I've just realized that something similar happened here. This is all about respect.Mance Rayder wasn't even that much liked by myself up till now, but I'm glad to report that on a freezing cold winter's morning (I call it my GAME OF THRONES Winter Is Coming The Wall Sensurround), here I sit with tears in my eyes. Like Ser Allister, when the chips were down, this guy really showed how to fly the flag.You will have to watch for yourself. I'm not giving the outcome away.A powerful word is invoked here. Respect. This show, through sparse scenes with a vast multitude of characters, achieves greatness beyond what I could possibly convey. These characters, whether good or bad, that doesn't matter... They're destined to be immortal legends in this modern classic.Coming from me, here for the actresses, much, much impressed by these stellar performances, this is the HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION.So scr*w the other reviewer... :)",

                    "content": "More than a few characters suffer from the patricide of last season. Strangely, Tyrion suffers the most while Cersei seems numbed by the whole ordeal. Despite being in mental slump, it is rather surprising to see that he lands in an exotic place. Lord Varys also accompanies him, he invests so much on Tyrion's survival and although he describes his intention in flowery words, there's always a lingering sense that ulterior motive still resides.The first episode sets a good tone for many characters, but bulk of it is spent on Daenerys and Jon Snow. After conquering and liberating cities and its occupants, Daenerys finds that the task of keeping the peace could be even harder. Some opposition force stalk her and her people from shadow, this time she can't sic mercenaries or dragons at them. It's an interesting part of her character as she puts a brave front as queen and can still be fragile at times, the show continuously uses this contrasting values as allure.Jon Snow rebuilds the wall, he's in a strange yet serendipitous position between Stannis and Mance. The two strong personalities are clashing, it seems that after scraping and resorting to dubious means for the better half of the series Stannis has become a force to reckon with. The North now is a momentary home for several armies, coalition or collision could spark at any moment since Stannis has bigger ambition and needs resource for that cause.A few other characters make a brief yet notable appearances. While the episode doesn't show much, it's still nice to see them, all breathing and such. The series has high production value, and the fifth season is no different. The stages are beautiful to behold and a couple of spectacles are nothing short of breathtaking. Costume and setting have been polished for medieval, desert and winter style respectively, although I'm not a fans of Tyrion's beard.Alliances, though they are uncanny, might be forged. The prospect of the bonds, as well as the characters who might share them, are fascinating hook for episodes to come.",

                    "content": "Game of Thrones has one of the best intros in the business and it's a welcome sight after a long wait for season 5. Ramin Djawadi's opening theme cries epic, one that is impossible to get sick of, whether you are tuning in week in week out or settling in for a season marathon. It's great to see the Eyrie and Pentos back on the map, as well as Winterfell no longer burning, albeit being garrisoned by a less than admirable Bolton house.We are presented with 3 major scenes from the get go; the 2 Lannister story lines, separated by the Narrow Sea, and Dany's reign in Meereen. The budget of GOT is evident by not only the Great Sept of Baelor which houses Tywin Lannister's dead body, but a very impressive special effects shot where the statue of Meereen tumbles down from the great pyramid. It signals a new era. Elsewhere both Varys and Cersei begin with very blunt dialogue. For Varys it's the least subtle he has been in the entire series, proclaiming his Targaryen loyalties immediately, while Cersei is presumably aware of Jaime's actions in freeing Tyrion. While Varys claims that Dany is stronger than Tommen and gentler than Stannis, Dany shows her immovable stance on slavery and the fighting pits in Meereen. It begs the question just how up to date Varys is with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e and if he is considering the wisdom of these potential rulers. In a more intimate scene Daario and Dany discuss the many affairs of being a queen post coitus. It's a distinct contrast between the normal royal presence of Dany with her loud proclamations and gestures. For once Emilia Clarke's acting shows the subtleties of her character and the stress of being such a young queen. It's another facet of Dany which we have not seen for a long time.The TV show equivalent of Stalwart Shield makes his first appearance in a memorable scene, the castrated Unsullied warrior paying a prostitute for a cuddle instead of the usual. It doesn't have quite the same impact here; taken out of its context of the paranoia and bloodshed of the Meereen war. It is instead used for the introduction of the Sons of Harpy, which is very effective, mostly due to the menacing gold mask. For those less attentive viewers there follows another scene where Missandei questions the motives of the late Unsullied. It is there to merely prop up the relationship angle of her and Grey Worm.To be even more blunt, Gilly spells out Ser Alliser's hatred for wildlings in our first look at Castle Black on the Wall. Hannah Murray as Gilly manages to shed her naivety in the new season by pointing out that Sam cannot leave the Wall just to follow her. Even Jon Snow isn't the boy who knows nothing anymore; in fact he's one of the most experienced men at Castle Black in the wake of the wildling assault last season. And he isn't without sexual experience either, as Mel finds out with a very blunt question which signals her intentions quite clearly. It's a far cry from the mysterious red women, the dark magic user that Davos has been so concerned about.It's great to see Robin Arryn all grown up, although his fan base (if it exists) won't be too eager about his swordsmanship. Even with his great name it's pretty clear that Littlefinger's focus is on the new and improved dark Sansa. Eugene Simon returns, although barely recognisable, as Lancel Lannister, a new servant of the Seven. His father as Kevan Lannister is also returning as a ruling presence in King's Landing. Time will tell what effect they have on Cersei, in addition to the Tyrell influence of Loras and newly crowned queen Margaery.The episode ends with Mance Rayder being burned alive, which is never pretty. It's a grim conclusion to the start of a grim season. While Dolorous Edd stands next to Jon Snow, two figures in Pip and Grenn have already departed. It's ambiguous what everyone thinks of Mance being made an example of in front of the wildlings, but for one exception; Jon, who takes pity and ends his life prematurely with an arrow through the heart. Amidst all the chaos of season 5, he will look to be firm and just. It's those qualities that are often attributed to kings, one of which is standing nearby as a free man burns. What is Stannis' next move? That and many more questions will be answered in the next 10 weeks.",

Because, like I said before when I reviewed Season 1, I had to catch up with the entire show online. So, with that out of the way, time to review Season 5 starting with this one.The Wars to Come continues where Season 4 left off with the two Stark girls heading off in different directions Arya and Sansa while Tyrion with the help of Varys arrive at Pentos after escaping from the Lannister family after being sentenced to death. Also, Jon Snow is continuing his duties at the Wall before two kings arrive, which finds himself caught.The first episode of Season 5 is a great episode. The performances are still good, the storyline's nicely written, the new characters are well-introduced, and the pacing never drags. My only quibble is that it doesn't quite live up to the high standards set by Season 4.Don't get me wrong. The writing's fine for the most part, but the reason I think Season 4 was the best because it raised the stakes to the events that would happen to some of the Lannister family members, the action sequences were engaging, the writing had gotten progressively stronger, and the character development was even more fleshed out.But while this episode isn't excellent, it's a great start to season 5 and looking forward to see how things will turn out.",

A lot of characters are about to meet and a lot of stronger forces are about to compete for the throne. Yet another season arrives, and this kicks it all off.The episode starts off with a flashback regarding Cersei eager to find out about her future and of course gets what she bargained for. It's a strong flashback that adds more depth and development to Cersei's current character in the show. The episode also instantly follows the events of the previous season and it instantly shows their outcome to the different characters throughout the kingdom. We also get to see Tyrion with Varys and their conversations together have always proved to be interesting throughout the seasons so it was entertaining to see them together again. It was also exciting that we finally get a Daenerys and Tyrion storyline crossover and it would be nice to see both of my favorite story lines to intertwine. Meanwhile at the Wall where Stannis now resides. Jon Snow is troubled as Stannis wants the help of the Wildling army to march into Winterfell and gives them a more than fair offer in return as long as Mance kneels down to him. In the end, a tense situation was brought upon Mance and audiences alike whether he would rather kneel or burn. He did not kneel and was steadfast in his decision, that was until the fire wavered upon him and Jon ended his despair with a shot of an arrow. Meanwhile with the Daenerys storyline, a masked man had murdered one of her men and she sought out to find the culprit. Dany seem to have been having a lot of trouble since the previous season, so she ought to reclaim her authority with her dragons which she locked up for about 1 season. In a big surprise, the dragons seemed to have despised her for locking them up and are furious at her. The problems and inconveniences seem to be stacking up in Dany's part and there's bound to be more. Let's just hope Tyrion fixes some of those problems when he arrives. The visuals were still looking classy and incredible and the dialogue and acting were still game of thrones standardsAs a setup, it sure did promise a whole lot to happen in this season and I hope it to be right. There's bound to be more deaths and shocking moments and for that I'm very excited for. +Cersei Flashback, +Outcome of Season 4, +A promising setup, +Stannis and Jon, +Tyrion and Dany, +Intense moments,Verdict: 8.3/10",

They film episodes in tandem and in parallel, showing say 3 stories in one episode and another 3 stories in next episode. This makes the show riveting and fresh and very new scene is about another character. ------------------",

I couldn't care less! We readers and viewers have to understand that one thing is a book, another thing is an audiovisual work. Both have merits on their own and both use different languages to speak for themselves. What comes first comes first, but I couldn't care less. After all the author is blessing the series, even directing some episodes, and he is all smiles about its route, so... why whining? What matters for me is quality, its juice - narrative with excellence. A story with layers and layers of reviving itself from the ashes, the mighty test of enduring when being hammered in flames, the plausibility of a character's metamorphosis (our own in life), the prevailing string of a persona's charisma: Shakespearean political plots vs. Humanism.That's what you will find in this episode. Forget about hysterical plot turmoils, Hollywood agendas and frantic compasses. You'll only find a solid narrative with delightful clues for the \"Wars to Come\". When you reaffirm the protocols of seeing good old \"Game of Thrones\" again and for the 5th time the episode has already finished leaving you with a watery eye. Son of a...!",

Also great was the scenes with Varys and Tyrion - this could have been played out with sympathy or regrets or feeling sorry but was very well shown by the main two leads. One of GOT's biggest strengths is the relationships between characters and this one should be great to see develop over the season.In summary, a decent start but you do get the feeling that more is to come in the season!",

But still, I understand that the books cannot be adapted word by word into a TV show. And still, WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS EPISODE? Can anybody answer me this: WHAT HAPPENED? I mean, storyline wise, WHAT HAPPENED? I have an answer: NOTHING. Nothing happened in this episode. Nothing of relevance. The only thing was the ending, where something actually did happen. But otherwise? Nothing at all happened. It was like \"oh look, there is Cersei. Oh look, there is Tyrion. Oh look, that's Tywin corpse.\" And? \"Nothing, there they are. You missed them, didn't you?\" OK, so you might say: this is the \"the-board-is-set\" episode, where they hint at us what could happen in the next. BUT NO. None of the scenes in this episodes where of any relevance. This episode might have been a \"webisode\" and it would have worked so much better. Because, you know what? They say this is the best series ever. The best series ever contains ten episodes per season. And they spend one of those ten on this? On another subject: Weiss and Benioff stated that they broke their rule of \"no-flashbacks\" because it would work. Well guess what? IT DID NOT. That useless scene of Cersei's flashback omitted the only reason of it's existence: (yes, as a person who has read the books, I'm going to say it) SPOILER ALERT! So, Maggy (the witch) tells Cersei \"you will not wed a prince, but a king\". We know what she meant: she would not marry Rhaegar Targaryen, but Robert Baratheon. She tells her \"your husband will have 20 children, you will have three\". We also know what that meant: Robert had many bastards, and Cersei had three illegitimate children. She also tells her \"you will be queen for a while, but then a younger one will come\". Yes, we also know what that meant: she's the queen, and then along comes Margery. We all know these because all of it are stated facts in the TV Show. We have seen them. SO WHAT WAS THE BLOODY POINT IN OMITTING THE OTHER THING MAGGY TELLS CERSEI?! WE ALREADY KNEW ALL OF THAT SHE TOLD HER!!! What was the point in not-showing that Cersei also asks Maggy how is she going to die?! Because, evidently, that's something we, the viewers, don't know!!! I hope they add THAT part in future episodes, because otherwise, I go back to my main point: in these episode absolutely nothing happened. Every scene was just a \"fill-in\" scene.What a terrible way to start the new season....",

People who have read the books will agree that introducing Lady Stoneheart was the perfect cliffhanger for \"A storm of swords\", but she was cut from the series, even though she plays a major role in the book which season 5 is based on.I can see how, maybe postponing her appearance might help the show, but why are they then premiering the new season with meaningless dialog, and outright stupid changes to the story?Why are we seeing Tyrion in the first episode? he adds nothing of value to it, his dialog with Varys is completely meaningless, and it seems as though they just shoehorned Tyrion and Varys into this episode because they're among the most popular characters. Also, by showing Tyrion we lose the mystery of the books, not knowing where he is, Cersei growing more paranoid by the day, burning down the tower of the hand in the process. We also get to see Dany, who also doesn't really add anything to the story, she sits on her throne and has some guy come in and ask to open up some fight club or whatever, I wasn't even paying attention at this point. Then she goes down to see her dragons, they're pretty mad at her. Alright, so.. what was the point in showing Dany now? She adds nothing to the story, literally nothing, we just see exactly what happened last season, she's left her dragons in a cellar, and now they're mad at her.At this point my jaw is almost dislocated from yawning so much, but hey here's Jon, surely this must be good right?Yeah, it's alright. We see Mance get burned and Jon shoots him to show him mercy. No complaints about this scene, there's some trivial changes but hey, I don't really care about those.So all in all, it's a boring mess of filler dialog, with too much show time given to the actors with the highest salary, all for the purpose of \"Hey look, it's Tyrion guys! you love Tyrion, right?\"The creators of the show have changed so many things from the books, almost abandoning them, to the point where it is spiraling out of a control and turning into a complete mess. They should have stuck to copying the books.",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.There are still signs of settling, understandably, with Season 5's second episode \"The House of Black and White\", but it is an improvement over the still very promising and well done season opener \"The Wars to Come\". It is a very daunting task living up to the consistently exceptionally high standard of Season 4 and this very early stage of Season 5 is doing a noble job on that front. What makes \"The House of Black and White\" a superior episode is that there is a bigger and bolder approach to the storytelling, rather than the slower, quieter and reflective tone of \"The Wars to Come\". There are more and bigger character moments (especially with Jon Snow and Brienne), characters having moral complexities, intensity-building and there is more emotion and drama. A better job is done advancing the story and character progressions while building upon the events of \"The Wars to Come\". Loved that there was more of Arya and Bronn, neither wasted, and Dorne is a worthy addition. All the acting is never less than very strong, can't think of a weak link here.Visually, \"The House of Black and White\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The House of Black and White\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.Summing up, the season has not quite settled yet but there is more than enough to make one convinced to keep watching. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The Queen mother continues to overstep her bounds and is not getting an easy path, but she really wields a lot of power and is filled with venom.

Littlefinger meets Brienne and needs to realize that she is incredibly committed to her vows, even though she has been mistreated all along. He, her adversary, should know that one who puts fear aside becomes incredibly dangerous. Dany may have made a great misstep but she feels she must maintain her power position. She now turns to fear.

                    "content": "As this episode opens we see Arya Stark for the first time this season; she has arrived in the city of Braavos and gone to the House of Black and White where she hopes to be reunited with Jaqen H'ghar\u0085 she doesn't get the reception she hoped for; the man at the door claims that there is nobody of that name there. After a night in the rain she heads into town and later on is confronted by a trio who think she will be an easy victim; this leads to her meeting Jaqen H'ghar and finally entering the House of Black and White. In Meereen a member of the Sons of the Harpy is captured; Daenerys is inclined to have him executed; something the freed slaves are keen to see. She is counselled against this course of action and agrees to hold a trial; however Mossador kills the prisoner believing that this is what Daenerys really wants. This leads to him being tried and executed\u0085 something the people are not happy about and for once Daenerys sees what it means to be unpopular with 'her people'. Elsewhere in Essos Tyrion and Varys are continuing their journey to Meereen.Back in Westeros Cersei is worried about her daughter; she is in Dorne and there are people there who are determined to have revenge on the Lannisters for the death 'The Viper'. Jaime offers to head south on a rescue mission; to this end he enlists the help of Bronn. Elsewhere Brienne and Podrick bump into Sansa and Petyr Baelish in a tavern; Brienne offers her services to Sansa but they are rejected. North at Castle Black Stannis offers to make John Snow Lord of Winterfell and give him the name John Stark but he won't renounce the oath he made to the Night's Watch. It is also time to elect a new Commander of the Night Watch; Alliser Thorne is expected to win but Sam proposes that John would make a better leader.I felt that this season started well but this episode is a step up from the opening instalment. It was great to see Arya again; Maisie Williams does a great job in the role. There is a decent amount of action; most notably when Brienne crosses swords with some of Lord Baelish's men. As well as actual action there is promise of more to come with Jaime and Bronn heading south to Dorne to rescue Myrcella. In Dorne we are introduced to Doran Martell; the local ruler who is played by Alexander Siddig of 'Star Trek: DS9' fame. The events in Meereen are amongst the episodes most interesting as we see Daenerys struggling to do the right thing\u0085 even if it makes her unpopular. Her missing dragon also makes a welcome reappearance although it remains to be seen whether it will come under her control. The events on the wall are interesting and after the election of the new Commander it will be interesting to see how those who didn't support him behave. There is also a nice scene between Gilly and Stannis's daughter; nothing dramatic but it was nice to see some normal interaction amongst all the plotting and power-play. Overall a good episode.",

                    "content": "It's quite clear that this show has been about the struggle for power, and it always has been. But I really like the episodes that particularly focus on that. Jon Snow, (possibly Jon Stark?), is somewhat unwillingly to take on another leadership role. Cersei struggles with the council, Tyrion misses the power, and Daenerys grapples with the right punishments. Even though there wasn't a whole lot of action, I loved tonight's episode. It was another one of the great dialogue episodes that the writers consistently give us. Whether it was Tyrion and Varys talking about the lack of power and what people do with it, or Stannis continuing to tempt Snow with possible leadership titles, it was a well written and directed episode.Arya arrived in Braavos to the House of Black and White only to find her old pal Jaqen H'gar! Obviously not reading any of the books I was quite pleasantly surprised to see him appear for the first time since season 2. Speaking of Starks, Brienne finally met Sansa Stark. Sadly, much like Arya, she wasn't too open to her protection. You have to feel for Brienne. She has spent the last few years trying to find the Stark girls and yet neither of them welcomed her. Fingers crossed they change their mind in the future. Jaime and Bronn are apparently on a trip to retrieve Myrcella from the Viper's wife and brother. I'm starting to really like these unlikely duos that go on adventures together. Brienne and Jaime, The Hound and Arya, and now Jaime and Bronn.It was once again really fun to watch Jon Snow and Stannis in the same scene. The characters that you grow to care about for seasons finally meeting is extremely fulfilling. Which is why it will be incredibly once Dany and Tyrion meet. Dany is really struggling with her power and the problem of the Sons of the Harpy. I would hope Tyrion and Varys would fill the gap that Jorah has left Dany in helping with the many political decisions that go along with leading these people. Hopefully next week will be that week.+Stannis & Snow's interactions +Power struggle +Unlikely duos +H'gars return -Brienne can't catch a break 9.0/10",

While the story haven't moved drastically or very intriguingly, it's still a show to wait and to admire. The production values here are like no other - you can simply watch this show for production values - they are truly create this rich world.Acting was as usually very solid from everyone involved. Directing is good, but this show has seen better, as well as writing. It's good, but not as good as it gets and this show has featured some series that were as good as they could possibly be.Overall, season 5 started good, but not great. I know that it's a slow burner start which will definitely lead us to a great and unforgettable moments, so it has to build it on something, and this \"something\" are these first two episodes.",

The city of Braavos is exquisite, both streets and rivers swerve as its vein while its buildings stand firmly in rigid tone. Different from the rest of story takes place, Braavos looks like an archaic tough monument. It's quite incredible how the show can produce such gallery of architectural glitz.My heart goes for Brianne though, even with the best intention, honor and will she can't seem to get any of the Stark girls to trust her. Apparently, after the ordeal they have endured trust is a rare commodity, understandably so. House Martell has a brief turn, discontent is clearly present as Oberyn was killed during trial by combat. It also presents another notable view of a particular garden, the nobles certainly have it good.Jaime is now preoccupied as he tries to save one of his remaining children. There's a change about him, a sad one. He doesn't look lively at all this season. No sudden lust, no smile and no witty quip either, the last one is definitely prove of stress. Jon Snow finds himself in brighter light, despite a series of unfortunate events he's had, he currently in receiving end of high favor, although how he accept it is another matter.Much of the episode highlights Daenerys' struggle to keep her city and people save. There's no ultimate right or wrong decision for her to take, generations of slavery and prejudice are hard to purge no matter how beautiful her speech is or how her men are committed to this cause. If there's anything to comfort her, she has myriad of allies on her side.Regardless of their potential perilous situations, many characters have come to terms with their relocations and hope that happier prospect would be brought by next episode.",

                    "content": "Sailing into Braavos for only the second time in the series is a much more expansive experience. When Stannis arrived last season we got a great overview shot of the Titan and the whole city, but this season with the ship captain rowing Arya in we get a feel of the busy bustling city, not just the inside of a bank. Although we don't get to visit every building, the House of Black and White is very impressive in its own right. The old man who answers the door is like Jaqen, mysterious and cryptic. In fact they are the one and the same, or maybe neither. It's a testament to the late Catelyn Stark that Brienne is still on her weary quest to find Sansa as she swore, even though there is really no evidence to suggest that anywhere would be safe for either of them. Apart from Sansa being protected by Littlefinger of course. It's also a testament to Littlefinger's persuasiveness that one of the last people in the seven kingdoms that can be considered honest and loyal can be portrayed as a failure and untrustworthy. It doesn't help that she wields a Valyrian steel sword with Lannister Lions on it, of course. Sophie Turner proved she can act in the confession scene of last season, although so far this season we have not seen much variety other than the bored teenager tone in her voice. Hopefully there are more opportunities for her to showcase her acting. One other criticism of this scene is Baelish's lack of awareness. It seems foolish to let Brienne walk away from the table given that she knows who Sansa really is, and what's more he has now lost a few of his soldiers in a pointless chase. An interesting dynamic between Westeros and Essos is seen in a pivotal scene between Dany and Barristan. Having served 3 different kings Barristan's wisdom is quite evident as he counsels Dany on the madness and injustice of his father Aerys. Dany takes the just and merciful route as she often has, although their remains a warning that this may not be the best option. It's an often conflicting persona that she has, as only recently she put to death many slavers and declared a new rule and world for Meereen. What's grating is that the show simplifies a very complex political situation in one of the largest cities in Essos. Nothing indicates that a fair trial exists within the city, because we don't get any real reference as to what the Sons of Harpy have done besides kill one Unsullied, or what this particular Son did. We have heard next to nothing of what happened in the retaking of Yunkai, and Hizdahr zo Loraq represents a simple proxy for the many masters and faculties of the city who all want a word with Dany. Nevertheless it's an emotional acting performance from the guilty former slave and a pretty good depiction of the slippery slope of Dany's decisions. It's a lose lose situation that she is losing control of, shown most obviously by the now even larger Drogon roosting on top of the Great Pyramid and flying away to wherever. Jaime and Bronn's on screen chemistry is evident and it's a great choice to send the pair of them to Dorne on a rescue mission. Although Cersei's conversation and biting remarks to her former lover and brother are quite characteristic, Jaime's motivation seems up in the air. He's never really shown much concern for his offspring, never mind an actual line of dialogue directed at Myrcella. It wouldn't be surprising if he shows up in the Water Gardens and cannot recognise his daughter, new actress or not.Even 2 season after the Red Wedding the remnants of the Stark line still live on and it is never better displayed than in the iconic Mormont line: Bear Island knows no king but the king in the north, whose name is STARK. Although Stannis' line about Thorne wanting to punish Jon for his bravery set back his character a bit, Janos Slynt's nominations speech certainly provides a case. We've seen how his character is multifaceted and not just a bitter commander, most of all in episode 9 of last season. But Sam makes the best case of all. His long standing loyalty and friendship with Jon shines through as he makes a very rousing nomination speech. Once again Jon is shown to be the one true good on the wall. But is he a Snow, or a Stark?",

We continue to see the struggles from nearly all the characters, some trying to keep hold of what power they have (Cersei, Danerys) others trying to keep hold of what they believe their purpose is (Brienne, Arya) and others who are unsure of what they want (Tyrion, Jon Snow). Highlights in particular were the election/voting at The Wall (where you knew Jon Snow would win that - as the people's vote!) and the scenes with Danerys. I'm sure i'm not the only one, but I really wanted Jon to take that offer from Stannis, but knew deep down that is too good to be true. Should be interesting to see how that plays out for Jon and Stannis.For Danerys, her glorious rise to power and overtaking other kingdoms was starting to become repetitive but now we actually start to see her losing her status of Mhysa, from the people and her dragons! It'll be fascinating to see if she can recover from this.Great to see a couple of familiar faces back too, in Bronn and Jaqen! With such a massive cast, it's no surprise, but always fun to see them back after a while.In summary, a good episode with more plot development!",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.There is less of a still settling feel here in \"High Sparrow\" than there was in particular the Season 5 opener \"The Wars to Come\", as far as previous episodes of the season go, which is a good thing. By all means, it doesn't fully explode, it is not the most action packed or pace-wise exciting of episodes and in comparison to other episodes not a lot feels like it's progressing forward. \"High Sparrow\" nonetheless scores very highly in making the characters interesting, the very adept handling of weaving all the different subplots together and introducing new characters and events promisingly set up. The standouts here are the High Sparrow introduction and the whole storyline with Jon, which has a lot of tense unpredictability.All the acting is strong, 'Game of Thrones' always delivers when it comes to the acting. Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke and Kit Harrington in particular.Visually, \"High Sparrow\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"High Sparrow\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.To sum up, a very good high flying episode indeed but not a 'Game of Thrones' favourite. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

Scenes involving the titular character and Arya's new training school are still fresh and involving at the moment, introducing new characters and re-introducing interesting old ones in an inviting way. There are some missteps, including a lengthy ten-minute chat merely to add in exposition for Brienne and Podrick, which I found entirely unnecessary. However, the new political intrigue at Castle Black is handled in a pleasing and mature way, leading to some great moments. A pity Tyrion has gone from being the best character in season four to such an irritation here.",

She is such a beautiful, sensual woman, but that sly smile speaks volumes. She has had an agenda for a long time, and now she is the queen. Cersei is relegated to a subservient role, sort of like the queen mother of England. The strength she has, however, is in her alliances. We can't forget that she is a cruel despot who has struck off the heads of many who have crossed her. Margery is planting seeds of dissent and playing Tommen for the child he is. She now wants total control of the castle, hoping to drive Cersei back to her original home. Lots is going on. Arya is now in the House of Black and White, where she is to become some kind of Jedi warrior. She is bossed around by a kind of Christ-like figure who demands she leave her identity behind. Where she is going and what she is to do is a mystery to us. John Snow has been give power and uses it in an act that would have been anathema before. We know it's necessary, but has it spoiled him. Littlefinger maneuvers Sansa into a marriage with a psychopath for political gain. Tyrion oversteps his bounds and this sets up Episode 4.",

Cersei comes to the marriage of her son Tommen and Margaery in King's Landing and he discloses that her mother asked him to not trust anyone. He asks Cersei whether she misses Casterly and then she meets Margaery. In the North, Theon listen to the conversation of Cerwin Roose Bolton and his son Ramsey about the best way to control the North through marriage. Little Finger and Sansa Stark head to Winterfell and he discloses his scheme against the Bolton, marrying her with Ramsey to seek revenge. Brienne follows Sansa and Little Finger and tells his life to Podrick and she tells that she will teach him how to fight. She also tells that she wants revenge against the death of King Renly. In Castle Black, Jon Snow meets Stannis and refuses his invitation to be the Lord of North. He tells that he will follow as Commander of the Night Watch. Stannis advises him to get rid of his enemies in Castle Black. Arya Stark throws her possessions away but the Needle that she hides in the rocks by the sea. Sansa arrives in Winterfell and Ramsey courts her. Jon Snow executes his enemy Lord Janos that refuses to obey his order. The group of High Sparrow promotes attacks sinners in King's Landing and Cersei meets High Sparrow and makes a deal with him. Tyrion is abducted in a brothel.\"High Sparrow\" is the greatest episode so far of this Fifth Season. All the segments are important and show the search of power by many characters. Cersei makes a deal with High Sparrow giving power to his fanatic group and controlling King's Landing. Jon Snow follows the advice of Stannis and gets rid of his greatest enemy in Castle Black. Sansa begins to follow the Machiavellian plot of Little Finger to retrieve the lands of her family. Arya is finally accepted to serve the Many-Faced God. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"High Sparrow\"",

                    "content": "As this episode starts we see Arya inside the House of Black and White; it isn't how she imagined; rather than learning how to fight she is sweeping the floor; it will take time before she can become no one and before she can stop being Arya Stark she will have to dispose of Arya's possessions. Back in King's Landing Margaery marries Tommen; a simpler wedding than when she married his brother but a far happier one. After the High Septon is humiliated by the puritanical 'Sparrows' he demands that Cersei has their leader executed; instead she pays him a visit and tells him that she supports the work of the faithful. At Castle Black Jon Snow once again declines Stannis's offer and must make his first decisions as Commander of the Night's Watch\u0085 including dealing with a long serving member who refuses to follow an order and seeks to undermine Jon's authority. Further South Sansa learns that she is being taken back to Winterfell where she is to marry Ramsay Bolton. Finally we see that Tyrion and Varys have arrived in Volantis; here Tyrion is recognised by a familiar face who grabs him and tells him that he will be taken to the queen\u0085 but which queen does he mean; Cersei or Daenerys?There is little in the way of action in this episode but that doesn't stop it being gripping. Once again Maisie Williams excels as Arya; managing to capture both her frustration and determination; the little of what we saw of the activities of the Faceless Men served only to make them more intriguing. Natalie Dormer's Queen Margaery continues to become more interesting; she always seems to be caring and polite but there is constant feeling that she has another agenda. Sansa Stark, played by Sophie Turner, has been a bit of a tragic figure since the death of her father and her betrothal to Ramsay seems to continue that although she seems far more spirited than she once was which only serves to improve her character. The events on the wall were impressive as they showed that Jon has what it takes to be Commander as well as providing the episodes only real action. The Sparrows, and the High Sparrow in particular, look likely to be more interesting in later episodes; largely thanks to Jonathan Pryce playing the High Sparrow. Overall I thought this was a great episode with plenty of interesting character and plot development; I can however understand those who want a little more action being disappointed.",

                    "content": "So Jaime and Daenerys took the week off but the show's quality absolutely did not. It was another week with several great character moments and a great example of just how good this show is with spreading the love to the entire cast. We learned more about the House of Black and White, saw new journeys for Sansa and Tyrion, and had many short but important moments with everyone else.The episode started with Arya doing the dirty work at the house and in turn had to basically give up her name as her first step of training. Throwing her clothes, coin, and nearly her sword into the water was pretty emotional. It just goes to show how long we have been following Arya and how much that sword meant to her. But it was fun to see Arya go off on that one girl and say some words I don't know that we have ever heard her say. We then were taken to the bedroom of Tommen and Margaery. It's clear that the latter doesn't have as much feelings as the former does. It's also clear that the actor sounds so much like Joffrey did and it was quite apparent tonight. Margaery also had a great scene with Cersei in which not a lot was said, but there was a lot that came out of it. Cersei is quickly falling down the ladders of power and Margaery is rising ever so fast. That scene clearly showed those two in their new and improved season 5 form.We then traveled north to visit Sansa and Littlefinger. Finding out that he was planning on having Sansa marry Ramsey was heartbreaking. She has been through arguably the most out of any character on the show and to land with a psychopath like him is tough to see. I hope there are better things to come for Lady Stark. Perhaps Brienne, who is just a few miles out comes in for the rescue? Speaking of Brienne of Tarth, her scene with Podrick reminded us of Stannis' faults and what the man is capable of. But I would like to think he has the best intentions. Once again him and Jon Snow had the best scenes of the episode with the ladder having to reject his offer. Stannis wasn't too pleased but realizes the honor in staying as the leader of the night watch. But as Stannis said, that honor got Ned Stark killed. Even at the end of the episode when Snow stands up and executes that man, it had shades of Ned in season 1. And it definitely mirrored Dany's issues last week.We ended with Tyrion in his quest to head to Meeren and find Dany. To be honest, it's so cool to even hear him say her name out loud. I have to imagine the book readers geek out over that. It's just as fun to watch Varys and Tyrion ride together for a long period of time. The line of \"I'm losing my mind\" or even \"I need to speak to someone with hair\" were hilarious. And finally we find Jorah, who looks to be on the edge, only to take Tyrion prisoner with the line of \"I'm taking you to the queen\". Having not read the books, I'm really interested to see how this plays out. Jorah is not on good terms with Dany and throwing Tyrion in there makes it all the more unpredictable. No matter, I'm definitely looking forward to next week as we are nearly one third of the way into season 5 already! +Arya learning the ways of being no one+Snow & Stannis scenes +Tyrion-Varys banter +Jorah pops up +Queen shift in power -Sansa's endgame seems frustrating 9.0/10",

Well, this new season seems to lose a lot of steam, not like what we have seen before. What we got so far: 1. Not even one episode really showed any potential to become great as before.2. Nothing but talk, talk, blab, blab and blab. Uninteresting dialog continued to an unbearable point.3. The storyline suddenly seems to lose focus on many important things that we want to know when Season 4 ended, but so far, I just failed to see any development to keep my concentration going further.Comparing this Season to the last four Seasons, it like watching two singing competition shows: If you never watched NBC 4 \"The Voice\" but only knew Fox 11 \"American Idol\", you would consider the latter is quite good, and those singers are pretty good, but, alas, once you watched \"The Voice\", then suddenly you know that all the singers on American Idol are not good enough, they are at a much much lower level than those singers on The Voice. To me, Season 1 to Season 4 of \"Game of Throne\" is like \"The Voice\", while Season 5 is like \"American Idol\"; without knowing how great the last 4 seasons were, Season 5 maybe still looked good enough, but definitely not great so far.I just hope the coming episodes would become better, but really doubt it.",

Margaery enjoys the fruit of her smile and skin, she seems confident as she challenges Cersei with typical in-law banters, subliminally sending crass thoughts and insult of age. If this were a show of different genre, I'd expect the visual filter turns red as Cersei channels her malicious intent silently.Jon Snow resides as Lord Commander, not the title he originally wanted or expected, but he must deal with a series of problem that come with the promotion. Stannis still irks him to join his cause and the incoming issue with the Wildlings must be settled soon. Another change in the North also happens as Sansa finally reaches her destination, it is definitely not what she had in mind, perhaps this one is worse for her to take.Arya is now an apprentice of some sort in Braavos to become nobody. The whole process is very vague, so is the reward. It's unclear if she wants a skill or near supernatural presence, thought at this point any means to her end will be welcomed. This practice proves to be taxing for her, and the \"wax on wax off\" method certainly isn't telling anything. A nod for Brianne as she tells the story of her childhood to her squire, Gwendoline Christie delivers a private and convincing tale.For a pariah on a strange land, Tyrion finds an equally bizarre allure of the people and place. Perhaps, the most surprising revelation is the change on himself. His time for reflection is short as he must use his silver tongue other than to channel liquor. It's certainly a good way to wrap up and built for incoming episode.",

                    "content": "Judging by Margaery and newly crowned King Tommen's post coital scene King's Landing has undergone a shift in power. Last week we saw Cersei's desperation to hold onto any last lingering power she may have in the capital and this week saw it slowly disappear before our very eyes. Seeing the very enthusiastic 16 year old boy reaction to his first lay and his na\u00efve plea for his mother to return to Casterly Rock, the show has promoted Tommen to the main cast and he is sure to play a bigger and more intelligent role in this season. The wedding ceremony is nowhere near as lavish as the Purple Wedding but it's quick and Cersei cannot do anything about it.The nostalgic Winterfell theme plays as Sansa and Littlefinger ride up onto the hill overlooking Moat Caitlin, after a very obvious cut from Roose Bolton discussing Ramsay's new proposed bride. It's a brave change which calls for Littlefinger to let his prized possession go into the hands of those horrible Boltons and back into her old home. Sansa's characterisation has been uneven to say the least but it's hard to recognise with so many story lines and over so many seasons. One minute she's bold and confident as she steps down the spiral stairs of The Eyrie in her new outfit and now she's the audience's proxies as Baelish once again weaves a supposedly masterful plan. To be fair to her no girl in the Seven Kingdoms would want to be married to Ramsay. How Roose exercises his control over him will be interesting to watch. There's a very different feel to Winterfell as Sansa returns to the restored castle. An old serving lady gives us a little indication that there are still people who recognise her claim with a solemn: \"The North Remembers\". It's not much but it is comforting for how long she has suffered. What's less comforting is Ramsay's promise to never hurt her. We all know cruel he really is, the most prominent example being the ragged and faceless man sweeping the Winterfell courtyards and struggling to suppress memories of the castle and of the elder Stark girl. Time will tell if Baelish's gamble pays off. Last week we got a great speech from Sam as he put forward Jon's case for being Lord Commander of the Night's Watch but it was a little cheesy when they all clapped his victory and also a little rushed. For Jon Snow all he had ever wanted was to be a Stark, be a part of Winterfell but Stannis' offer to legitimise him was overshadowed and given a lot less significance than it should have had. Thus, Jon's refusal isn't so much a dilemma but a relatively easy decision. It's not the greatest reason to stay either, even with his knowledge of the coming White Walker army. Davos tries his hand at convincing him, but even his political savvy, far better than Stannis has shown, has no effect. But for what it's worth we know Jon Snow is a capable man. He has been a good, just and honourable leader throughout the many troubles at and beyond the wall. He shows this at once by recognising Ser Alliser's worth and appointing him First Ranger. Immediately after he hits his first barriers as Lord Commander, in the form of a cowardly and disobedient Janos Slynt. Even Thorne knows what a fatal mistake he has made by refusing an order and openly insulting Jon. More and more we see Jon emulate the qualities of his adopted father. The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword, uttered Ned so long ago. And so he does. It's a powerful and significant action by Jon which hammers down his authority. Stannis' nod only reinforces it as the right decision. They do a good job of hammering the point home of Arya's tendency to hold onto her Stark identity, even if it is less than subtle. She finds a very convenient hiding spot for Needle which signifies that someday she just might return to that part of her life, despite what the life of a Faceless Man entails. Complete and utter abandonment of your identity is no easy task and if Arya is in it only to tick off those remaining names on her lists she might find herself lying more often than not. Even in Volantis the actions of the dragon queen are widespread and well known and as in Westeros that manifests into whore house gimmicks. Tyrion find himself speaking to someone \"with hair\" for the first time in weeks, and to my astonishment, charming her to skip the payment. That desire quickly vanishes however at a touch of her arm; perhaps memories of the last whore he bedded surfacing. It's very odd for him to still harbour feelings for Shae, who had been sleeping with the last person Tyrion wanted her to be with at the end of last season. He of course apologised to the corpse who had momentarily tried to murder him with a knife so it's anybody's guess were Tyrion's mind has wandered to this time. In any case we are getting fast forwarded to Dany quite quickly in the form of the banished Jorah, who hopes that the Lannister prize might curry his ex-queen's favour. Next week at last we get the fast talking Lannister against the Dragon Queen. Recipe for disaster or fortune?",

A clear sign that bad writing was going to prevail more and more. When the episode first aired, one could pretend it was just a bit weird, thus thinking \"let's wait and see\". But then, later the downfall has become more and more massive. This episode is a sort of pivotal element for the dull story lines that will follow in seasons 5 & 6.",

Then we have a drunk dwarf in a wagon with a eunuch (sounds like a bad joke), riding to meet Daenerys Targaryen, named in this episode \"the savior\" by a red priest like Melissandre, does anyone else smell \"Faith war\" approaching? And talking about faith, we finally see some new trouble starting to erupt in King's Landing, and for those of us that read the books: We know that the problems are just getting started for Cersei Lannister, aka The queen mother. Finally I can say that HBO is doing it right. I can only wonder what's in store for next week, but rest assured, it's going to be awesome!!",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Wars to Come\", \"The House of Black and White\" and \"High Sparrow\" were very good to great previous episodes from Season 5. \"Sons of the Harpy\" manages to be even better than them, while not one of my favourite 'Game of Thrones' episodes or one of the show's magnum opuses, it was with this episode where Season 5 started to properly settle. While there is evidence of the quieter and intricate tone seen in the previous three episodes, \"Sons of the Harpy\" balances that and brilliantly with brutally bold action, insightful characterisation and development (the one possible exception being Sansa, who the episode could have done more with), surprising twists and revelations and drama that feels intense and emotional. Of the four episodes, it is with \"Sons of the Harpy\" where it felt the most like the storytelling and characterisation were evolving and moving forward.'Game of Thrones' has never failed to deliver on the acting. \"Sons of the Harpy\" doesn't disappoint in that regard with strong performances across the board, regardless of any reservations with Sansa it to me doesn't lie with Sophie Turner but merely that the character pales in comparison to stronger characters that have had more development and exposure.Visually, \"Sons of the Harpy\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Sons of the Harpy\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.Summing up, excellent episode if not quite one of my favourites. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Margaery implores her husband to have him released but he is weak when it comes to confronting High Sparrow's followers. In the North Melisandre attempts to seduce Jon Snow and Sansa learns that her protector Lord Baelish is going to leave her in Winterfell while he returns to the capital. In the South Jaime Lannister and Bronn reach Dorne and soon come into conflict with local soldiers.Across the Narrow Sea in Essos Tyrion learns that his captor is Jorah Mormont and that he is taking him to Queen Daenerys not Cersei; something that comes as a relief. Meanwhile in Meereen Daenerys is still having problems; people are still petitioning her to reopen the fighting pits and even more worryingly the Sons of the Harpy are rising in force to attack those loyal to Daenerys, including her army of unsullied.The opening three episodes only featured a limited amount of action but here there are multiple scenes of violent action; the Faith Militant's attacks in King's Landing, Jaime and Bronn fighting a quartet of Dornish troops and finally the fight between large numbers of the Sons of the Harpy and several Unsullied. These action scenes were impressively filmed and rather exciting. Away from the fighting there was the usual scheming; most notably Cersei's moves against the Tyrells which shows Margaery that her power, through her husband, isn't what she thought. As expected the cast do I fine job; I particularly enjoyed some of the quieter scenes such as those between Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau and Jerome Flynn as Jaime and Bronn; Peter Dinklage and Iain Glen as Tyrion and Jorah Mormont; Sophie Turner and Aidan Gillen as Sansa and Lord Baelish and Kit Harington and Carice van Houten as Jon Snow and Melisandre\u0085 these could be seen as relatively minor parts compared to the action and more obvious scheming but they were still enjoyable. Overall I'd say this was a really good episode; certainly the most exciting of the season so far.",

The two road trips were great as we caught up with of Jaimie and Tyrion are doing. We got the beginnings of some serious battles between Daenerys and the Sons of the Harpy, and more progress in Cersei and Snow's respected endeavors. It was a fantastic episode, and probably my favorite of the season so far.Jaimie and Bronn together were so entertaining. It's fascinating to think about how much Jaimie has changed since season 1. When he says he wants to die in the arms of the woman he love, I actually think that's about Brienne. As crazy as it is to think it's not Cerseii, I just think he feels more obligated to Cerseii instead of where his legitimate feelings lie. It's also unlikely he will hurt Tyrion, that's more of him just covering up his tracks to Bronn. Speaking of Cerseii, her scenes this week mostly lied with the council and the High Sparrow. The council is a lot smaller than it used to be and I think it was once a lot better. Arresting Loras was right up Cerseii's alley and it's just another reason for Margaery to hate her. Watching Tommen try to free him was very entertaining. He is such a na\u00efve boy and completely whipped towards Margaery. What a man would do for his woman, huh? Onto the north, Stannis sees a lot in Jon Snow, but apparently so does Melisandre. Was I the only one who was legitimately wanting to yell at the screen to tell him to resist her? Snow also had to sign for Bolton unwillingly. It was heartbreaking to know that he had to sign that agreement knowing everything that Bolton had done to his family. I hope now that Baelish is planning for an alliance with Stannis, we get to see Sansa reunited with Jon. The Starks need some happy moments. Considering we got a heartwarming scene with Stannis and his daughter, I think they are repositioning him as a good guy on this show.The last 10 minutes of the show or so were dedicated to Tyrion and Jorah's trip to Daenerys. Glad to see that he was indeed taking him to Meereen instead of King's Landing. By the preview next week, we may be getting our first interaction between the two, EVER. The Sons of the Harpy fight at the end was done really well, and it just gave us more of a reason to need Tyrion and his wit. Dany is losing so much, and now presumably both Barristan and Grey Worm? Harsh times ahead for her. It may be awhile before we see her on the Iron Throne.+Road trips +Tommen and his immaturity +Sons of the Harpy +Snow and his honor +Baelish reveals some plans +Next week's possibilities...-Screw Melisandre! 9.5/10",

First off all both of them were longer in running time - that's a good thing. There were also more action, although action is just one of the parts (and not the most important) which makes this show great. Plot is moving to interesting directions, and while there some stops here and there, overall i'm intrigued.Overall, episodes 3 and 4 were superior then first two. Bigger, bloodier, more intriguing. At this point we are still far from end of season 5, but something tels (no i haven't read books, so i'm fresh here) me that this season is going to be more of buildup for future events. I kinda had this idea first when they announced directors for season 5 and there weren't \"heavyweighter\" from previous seasons. Sure, there will be meaningful events, but so far everything is moving not very fast and more on a buildup level. Still, this is a great show so far no matter what direction it goes.",

Everyone practically bleeds or suffers some sort of unfortunate fate today. Cersei has armed a militant based on faith, it's a very arbitrary group as it incarcerates anyone who is seen disruptive, but the category is wide and ambiguous. The pretext works however, as the new established militant serves her goal and vexes Margeary, which in turns create a rift on the royal newlywed's relationship.Meanwhile at North, both Stark siblings find themselves in contradicting side although they might not know the whereabouts of the other. Jon Snow is still wanted by the advancing army of Stannis, one must praise his honor as he deflects another charming offer. In a more heartwarming scene of his entire campaign, Stannis showcases his affection towards her daughter. This is probably the best performance by the father-daughter actors to date.Remarkably, the North is the only segment which doesn't draw any blood. Jamie finally reaches the land of his captured niece, he's in full redemption mode, a tad sorrowful for this season. Chemistry between him and Bronn is witty and entertaining. Bronn is smarter than he'd like to show and Jaime requires his companionship, perhaps more for a trusty friend than a hired thug, although the swordsmanship proves to be useful either way.The south has intriguing culture, aside for their elegant in handling spear, apparently they also have all female squad which has high tolerance to violence. The theme of militant is as thick as the blood they spill in this episode. Sons of Harpy deliver another more lethal blow and this time they do so openly. It ends on a high note as one of the more visceral action sequences wraps up the episode.This marks one of the bloodiest showing in the series. It'd take time to dress the wound of many characters and clean the stain from many walls.",

                    "content": "A copper viper entwines itself around an upright spear as the intro takes us to yet another new location within Planetos, Dorne, which we saw a little of the royal palace in Sunspear last week. But it's Jorah's sneaky nigh-time robbery of a fishing boat which we open to. He's never been the most moral knight in Westeros having resorting to slavery to please his old wife, and now it seems he will do anything in order to get back to his Dragon Queen, his new love. Also sneaking around in the night-time are Jaime and Bronn, who's partnership has gone beyond secret sword-fighting lessons to secret search and rescue missions into the one kingdom that Aegon the Conqueror never conquered. They stand proudly next to their words; Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. The 3 Sand Snakes stand with Ellaria Sand as they plot their revenge for the Red Viper's death. They are the living evidence of Oberyn's widespread travels and affairs. Which is why it puzzles me to see them pretty much assume the standard Dornish attire and appearance. The accents all sound the same. For once GOT sways into the realm of cosplay.Which brings us to two pivotal Lannister characters which I feel are going wayward with their characterisation. Jaime expresses contempt at Tyrion's act of kin slaying but although Jaime has always respected and admired his father for his feats and standing there was not much love there. He so easily refused to be heir to Casterly Rock and even smiled at being disowned from the family following that argument, and later was very quick to reinstate this claim in order to save Tyrion's life. It's a sudden turnaround of these loyalties; as shown by the camaraderie between the brothers in the various prison exchanges last season. Elsewhere Cersei has suddenly given the new High Septon (Sparrow) the authority to rearm the Faith Militant and effectively grow their own personal army. Where is this sudden goodwill and trust coming from? Cersei has shown varying degrees of idiocy and intelligence over the seasons but above all else she cares about herself and her family. If she wants to lead the faith to weed out Loras Tyrell as a sinner surely there is no need to allow them to create their own personalised military to run amok in King's Landing? Because as Jonathan Pryce has shown this new leader needs no bribery and is not swayed by the worldly riches of food, wealth and sex. And what is the objective of Cersei in locking up Loras? Surely as the sole heir to Highgarden she'd want to be wed to him after losing her power as Queen Regent. It's overall a horrible decision by Cersei, but it's the fact that it is uncharacteristic of her to make it without a very strong or evident motivation. The calm demeanour of Lena Headey's acting is therefore jarring to what her actions actually bring about. What follows is a nice scene which demonstrates a few things. One, the battle inside Selyse Florent's mind between the Lord of Light's service and the love of her family. She's already shown this before when questioning Melisandre about the use of love potions with Stannis. Next, we see Sam's resourcefulness as he sends pleas of help to all of the North for men and supplies in wake of the devastating effects of the assault on Castle Black. Finally we still see a hint of Jon's upbringing as he hesitates at the sight of Roose Bolton's name. Even if he refused Stannis' offer of legitimising him his Stark blood still boils in his veins. Jon Snow knows some things like love and loyalty, even if he has no idea where the heart is. It's been a long time coming but finally we see the legendary Ser Barristan Selmy in action. From Jaime Lannister to Ned Stark we've heard praises of his fighting prowess but perhaps his age has caught up with him. The menacing masks of the Sons of Harpy are a frightening sight in themselves but does not say much about their combat ability, holding small daggers in their hands as they prance Catwoman like in the chambers of Meereen, fighting as if their controllers are stuck and they can only aim at the throat. For Barristan perhaps a weary body and lack of armour excuses him from winning an outnumbered battle but for the hardened Unsullied warriors it is a disappointing outcome. If any of the nameless warriors showed even half of Grey Worm's ability they wouldn't fall so easily to unarmoured slavers wielding daggers. But for the sake of a cliff-hanger ending their years and years of combat training and unrivalled discipline seemingly disappears along with their advertised tolerance against pain. How hard is it to slip in a line mentioning the lack of Wine of Courage? For the sake of Dany I hope both of them survive.",

In Meeren, Dany is having some trouble while ruling, and remember, conquering is not ruling. The Sons Of Harpy appear from where they are hiding, and eventually kill some of Dany's Unsullied. Unfortunately, the episode ends in a major cliffhanger where Grey Worm and Ser Barristian Selmy's fate is unknown. Believe me, I feel season 5 is going to top all seasons and things are turning intense as this season progresses.",

With only 10 episodes a season we can't afford this.2. The scene introducing the Sand Sisters was cheesy and poorly acted. Looked like a scene from a cheap SciFi show.3. The fight scenes were just terrible! Lanister stopped a sword with his gold hand- no one saw that coming. And the final fight scene with the Sons of the Harpy was a joke of choreagraphy. It could have been an amazing way to show the Unsullied vs a decent foe but instead it was a bunch of Harpies getting behind them to slit their throtes- come on you can come up with something more imaginative than that.4. The fact that he head sparrow so easily is manipulated by the queen is sad. And the Sparrow club bearing fighters were pretty lame as well.I LOVE GoT so much- that's why I took the time out of my day to write this. Hopefully it will be a drop in the bucket towards convincing HBO to either invest real time and money into the fight scenes or fire the director of this mess.",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 5 was a very well done one, but of the five seasons up to this point of 'Game of Thrones' it for me took the longest to completely settle. All the previous Season 5 episodes were very good to great, especially \"Sons of the Harpy\" (the biggest, boldest and most brutal), but it was that episode that felt the most settled. This is continued with the halfway point episode \"Kill the Boy\".\"Kill the Boy\" is not as big, as bold, as violent, as surprising or as crisp, but it's far from dull and never less than interesting even with the slower pace and more intimate atmosphere. Do wish that the newer characters had more to do and that there was more to Sansa's character. Having said that, there is a good amount of insightful character development still, compelling drama and very promising story progression, it actually does feel like things are moving forward.'Game of Thrones' has never failed to deliver on the acting. \"Kill the Boy\" doesn't disappoint in that regard with strong performances across the board, old and new. There are no exceptions, even with the least interesting characters.Visually, \"Kill the Boy\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. The visual effects are some of the best of any television programme and are not overused or abused, the scale, the detail and how they actually have character and soul are better than those in a lot of the big-budget blockbusters. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Kill the Boy\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It is hard not to be bowled over by the quality of the writing, outstanding isn't a strong enough adjective to describe how good the writing is once again. It always has a natural flow, is layered and thought-provoking and demonstrates a wide range of emotions. The story is still riveting, with plenty of passion and sensitivity.To conclude, very good episode but 'Game of Thrones' have done better. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The emphasis isn't on action and bloodshed but rather the majurity of the characters and the political actions they need to take and the consequences they need to face. Jon and Sansa are on particularly strong form here when facing up to their situations, with strong support from Tormund, Roose and Ramsey. Meanwhile, Daenerys is the most interesting she's been in a while. The final moments with Jorah and Tyrion remind one of what a fine actor Iain Glen is.",

She brings in the city's family leaders. She feeds one of them to the dragons, a horror filled scene. We don't know at this point if the carnage will continue, or if she is making a point. At first it appears to be the former. Things change however. The most interesting story takes us back to Theon and Ramsey, the utter psychotic \"possible\" son. He is totally evil, embracing the fear of everyone. He is also a coward because he has only accomplished things through his being shielded by his power base. He abuses women and plays psychological games with Sansa. He knows that she is vulnerable. She has grown some and believes that Littlefinger will do something to help her, but we will see how much this trust is worth. The forces under John Snow and his people amass and head out to face the Boltons. In a nice hook, we have Jorah hoping to appease the Dragon Lady with Tyrion. Unfortunately, they are accosted by the people who have become savages because of greyscale. The concluding scene sets up an interesting road ahead.",

The intention of Lord Commander Jon Snow to make an alliance with the Wildlings will certainly bring consequences. Daenerys new decisions about people of Meereen will be right or wrong? The encounter of Sansa and Theon is cruel. Mormont is infected and is difficult to foresee his fate. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Kill the Boy\"",

                    "content": "The previous episode left us wondering about the fate of Ser Barristan Selmy and Grey Worm; here we learn that the former has died and the latter was seriously wounded. Daenerys decides that she must take action and has the leaders of the city's richest families arrested and brought to her. She takes them to her dragons who kill and eat one of them; she warns that the same may happen to one of the others the next day but ultimately decides on a different strategy after a talk with Missandei. Elsewhere in Essos Tyrion and Jorah Mormont reach the ancient, abandoned city of Valyria where they see the third of Daenerys's dragons and are attacked by a group of Stone Men.Back in Westeros Jon frees the Wildling Tormund Giantsbane and agrees on a plan to get the Free People north of the wall to help in the coming war in exchange for land south of the wall. Meanwhile Stannis prepares to head south in an attempt to liberate Winterfell. At Winterfell Sansa meets Theon for the first time since she left for the capital with her father in Season One. She is also told that she has friends who are looking out for her.This was another fine episode with some solid plot advancement. Daenerys's story moved along nicely; showing both her hard side and a more conciliatory side. The way her dragons burnt and ate one of her prisoners was impressive; one could almost believe that dragons were real. The scenes featuring Peter Dinklage and Iain Glen as Tyrion and Jorah Mormont were a delight with some enjoyably dialogue, spectacular scenery and a dramatic struggle against the Stone Men. It was great to finally see the Stone Men after they have been mentioned many times in relation to what will happen to those suffering from grey-scale. The events in Winterfell were tense; one never knows if Iwan Rheon's Ramsey Bolton is going to do something horrible; any time he is on screen there is a feeling that something bad could happen at any moment. The scene where he torments Theon in front of his father and Sansa was particularly uncomfortable. The scenes at Castle Black may not have been as tense but they were still interesting; Jon's mission to recruit Wildlings and Stannis setting off towards Winterfell both promise interesting events to come. Overall another really good episode even though many major characters did not feature.",

                    "content": "Halfway through the season, things are starting to be put into place for Game of Thrones. I can't say this was an overly entertaining episode, but it served as a set up as for what's to come in the final 5 episodes. I know some people have been complaining about how slow this year has felt. I haven't seen it that way, I think we have gotten some of the best character drama and new interactions this year. Unfortunately, although good, I think this week was probably the worst of the season.The promo showed Tyrion seeing dragons for the first time and I just assumed they would be closing in on Meereen. But I forgot that one of Dany's dragons had left her for the time being. So no, Tyrion and Daenerys don't meet in the episode, but we did get some dragon action. Coming off of last week's troubles with Hizdahr, Dany was forced to make another difficult decision with Barristan dead and Grey Worm seriously wounded. In typical Daenerys form, she decides to feed one of his men to her dragons, and debated giving Hizdahr to them. After a few talks with Missandei, she decides against killing him and instead forms an alliance and agreement. But apparently wants a husband in the process. I do wonder what this means for Naharis. Meanwhile, on the way to Meereen, Tyrion and Jorah ran into a few Stone Men. Of course, we had to believe that even if they had beaten them, someone was going to be touched by the stone creatures. Jorah takes the heat there, as we will have to wait and see what kind of long term ramifications it ensues.Jon Snow had another big week. He had to make some decisions regarding the wildlings future at the wall. Releasing one of his former friends turned enemy was a cool moment for Snow. It's just great to see a character that has gone through so much like Snow, get to exhibit his power and ultimately his likability. Unfortunately it looks as though Snow will be leaving with the Wildlings to save their people, along with Stannis leaving for Winterfell. It's disappointing to see the Stannis and Snow dynamic end, but hopefully sometime down the line we will see a reunion. Speaking of Winterfell, we got a lot of Ramsay material this week, as disturbing as it is to watch him. He borderline raped his so called 'lover' and then forced an awkward dinner upon his future bride, because why the hell not, it's Ramsay and he loves to just be the biggest jerk on the show. But it did give us a great look at the improved Sansa. She's in a terrible position already but I feel like her attitude is changing and she's beginning to stand up for herself. Her face when she saw Theon and questioning Ramsay's mother showed the possible future nature of a fierce Sansa.So a lot of cool things this week but not much material to go crazy about. I do feel like it will be the last slowly paced episode as we head into the final stretch of season 5. And soon we will eventually get that legendary meeting between Tyrion and Daenerys. It seems like next week will be a much bigger and more intense episode.+New and improved Sansa +Snow continues to do likable things +Dragon action +Stannis heading to Winterfell -Stannis & Snow's dynamic ends-Pacing was slow 7.8/10",

                    "content": "The North sees a lot of movement this episode. Both warring parties have their own contradicting internal turmoil. Jon Snow opts for political merging and compromise while Ramsay uses his newly found power to oppress. The relationships between Jon Snow and the Wildlings are precarious, though it's probably the most peaceful one to achieve reconciliation. While some challenges persist, Jon pursues the best way for both groups to prolong their life expectancy against the unworldly threat.Iwan Rheon as Ramsay is a fitting antagonist. He displays a convincing euphoric reaction when people bow to his will. Unlike many other characters with cloak and dagger, Ramsay is more openly on his perverse achievements. Theon Greyjoy is truly a lost cause, the show invested a whole season on breaking him with mind games and castration, this is a fate worse than half of the deaths.It's been awfully strange, mainly because the overwhelming discomfort, when Theon is paraded in front of Sansa. The two have not been close, this time they find themselves as captives though their circumstances may be different. As usual there are increasing amount of people who might just soil the budding flower persona of Sansa, but it seems that she's not as alone as she thinks.The last act of the episode is a visual eye candy as Tyrion and Jorah Mormont have leisure sail over the mythical haunted land. This set piece is strikingly beautiful, worthy of any fantasy tale. These two characters are a unique pair, they are nothing alike in term of personality yet they must endure each other and any outside threat the elegant vista might hide.Some men are luckily absolved and granted more than life, while the rest might be tragically doomed.",

                    "content": "Emilia Clarke's acting has always been a roller-coaster in GOT and the start of this episode is yet another example. The pros and cons of a stage actress means that at one moment Dany can be fierce and the other she can be annoying or detached. We've seen one end of it when she liberates Yunkai in a very impressive fashion and tonight when she threatened the heads of the slaver families we saw the other. While the sound design and visual effects of the dragons are remarkable, Clarke's tone sounds little like a reaction to the death of an adviser and close friend. Furthermore it's a stunning backflip on the justice she deals out earlier in the season by sentencing Mossador to death after he himself kills a Harpy. Once Dany believed in a fair trial and the crowd and her reaction to that execution made us aware that this was a heavy issue, yet suddenly she is prone to roasting this slaver without a moment to spare and flaunting the beasts she suddenly can control with ease (despite only 2 weeks ago failing to appease Drogon, or the traumatic scene in which she locks up Rhaegal and Viserion). And you can't even chalk it up to an act of passion because she is surprisingly calm during the whole affair. And what about Greyworm? His and Missandei's relationship advances another level as they contemplate the Harpy's latest attack which left a legendary knight dead and the commander of the Unsullied severely injured. They've managed to add a romantic angle which isn't necessarily bad but it's a unconvincing explanation which trivialises the ending of that fight scene even further than it already had been with the poor choreography and such. Now then what happens to the whole Daario speech about the Unsullied forgetting how to fear? Or do the writers simply apply a certain degree of ambiguity and hope it all sounds okay? \"To forget how to fear is to forget how to hide\" and \"it takes courage to admit fear\" all sound a lot less meaningful when the show has failed to create a mood of fear itself in Meereen. There's barely any shots of the streets or civilians of the city, the skirmishes (3 at last count) take place in crowded and dark locations and the entire slaver body is represented by a few old men and Hizdahr zo Loraq. The compartmentalisation and streamlining of the entire storyline means a lot less dramatic tension. What's the loss of Barristan if the handy replacement in Jorah is on his way (although he himself may have some grayscale problems)? What's the loss of a few Unsullied soldiers when she still has eight thousand? And who else could be the leader of the Harpy rebellion but Hizdahr himself? They certainly haven't given us any other options because they've simplified the arc so much. Kill the boy is the title of this episode and the underused Aemon Targaryen gives a short but dramatic speech to the new Lord Commander in an attempt to help him trust his own judgement. Jon makes the same offer of peace that he made to Mance Rayder to Tormund. Although their relationship has never been as fleshed out as it could have been, even he understands the importance of the offer for the free folk. So with the chains off it's not pride or revenge he chooses, but compromise. If the Night's Watch was divided before it is even more so now. Even long time supporter Dolorous Edd cannot look past the deaths of his brothers. Yet it is hard to ignore the bigger issue of the White Walkers' wight army which will only get larger with so many helpless wildlings to feast on. You have to blink twice to believe it but Ramsay Snow is actually being nice. We saw a similar scene last season with Reek's bath but this one lacks the tension of that. It's a lot less subtle and the dialogue at the dinner scene and also Sansa's overall seems to just tell the viewer what a strange and alien place this is compared to the warm Winterfell we know from season 1. Myranda's conversation with both her and Ramsay seem to be guilty of this too. On the other hand, Roose and Reek's acting is still as stellar as they have always been and I think they have nailed the casting of Fat Walda Frey. Her character presents a few dilemmas and questions for Ramsay; although this nice guy persona has been brought about by the promising engagement to Sansa Stark, the baby in her belly stands a future threat. \"The North Remembers\" is an iconic line in the series and its disappointing to say the least to have it reduced to this. Although we have always known that some remnants of the North are still loyal to the Starks, it's a little less comforting to have it come from the mouth of an old serving lady. Who knows what will come when and if Sansa lights that candle? It's certainly less inspiring than how I would have envisioned it and I'm sure Sansa feels the same. For now it's not even a question that needs answering because Ramsay and the rest of the Boltons recognise her value. What will Littlefinger think of this secret Northern conspiracy? Or is he even aware? We end with Tyrion and Jorah sailing through the ruins of Valyria. It's the first time since the fantastic ending of season 1 where we have really seen the look of amazement and wonder at the sight of the dragons who were thought to have been extinct. That quickly changes to horror when the fabled Stone Men attack them, with the threat of the very contagious grayscale that Shireen Baratheon also bears. Suddenly the stakes for Jorah reach new heights. How will this affect his actions and loyalty to Dany's cause?",

                    "content": "The opening four episodes of this season of Game of Thrones felt different to the first four years of the show. The writing was slower, opting for a rather lengthy build up feel. The character motives were more political, characters like Jon and Daenerys being given material a far cry from anything they'd had before. Coincidentally, these were the only episodes sent out to critics before they aired for initial reviews, ultimately leaking online soon after. This led to my speculation that Kill the Boy would be the episode where the show's fifth season halted the build up and went truly haywire. Much to my prediction, the build up did in fact stop here. But so did the narrative. It's difficult to come out of episode five with a sense of accomplishment; Kill the Boy may go down as the slowest and most conceptually bland episode the show has ever put out.Thankfully, it's still compelling television. Game of Thrones would have to go seriously downhill for it to put out an actively weak episode; most 'dud' episodes tend to just be poorer in comparison to the show's extraordinary standard. Kill the Boy is still packed with the visual flare viewers love about the show; the scenic CGI as Stannis' army marched away from Winterfell was stunning, and our eventual insight into Valeria demonstrated the show's knack for breathtaking photography. There was also some nicely symbolic moments in episode five, namely Daenerys' plan to marry Hizdahr zo Loraq. Dany is a character who began the show being forced into a marriage against her will, so it's an interesting development that she is now willing to use the concept of marriage for her own political gain. I also particularly enjoyed Stannis and Sam's brief sequence for a number of reasons. On paper they make an interesting pairing, but when you add the fact that Sam himself killed a White Walker, Stannis feels less important in comparison. This kind of thoughtful character work is what just about saved this episode from falling flat on every level.Those familiar with Game of Thrones understand its ability to cut between five or six, sometimes even seven or eight locations per episode. Kill the Boy is content with just three, which is a risky move. When the show resorts to just one location per episode, like in season two's Blackwater (my personal favourite episode of the show), the scale is increased in order to sustain it. Besides season four's Wall-focused battle episode, I think I'm correct in stating that Kill the Boy is the first episode to entirely remove King's Landing from the equation. And the episode suffers for it. There isn't enough variety to keep the show compelling; we lost the progress of Arya's efforts in Braavos, and we lacked the interesting political happenings of Cersei and Margaery. By resorting simply to the North, the Wall and the general surroundings of Meereen, episode five feels almost bland compared to the rest of this season.The highlight of Kill the Boy is undoubtedly Iwan Rheon's performance as Ramsay Snow, I mean, Bolton, who makes for the most compelling dinner sequence the show's offered since Arya served for Tywin (aw, remember him?) back in season two. Rheon conducts this sequence with a horrifying glint in his eye that suggests Ramsay is well on his way to being one of the most interesting villains the show has right now. Unfortunately this was followed by a seemingly misplaced sequence between him and his father, in which the episode comes to a complete halt. It's the kind of narrative mistake one would expect from a small scale ITV drama, not from one of the most critically acclaimed fantasy shows the world has ever seen. Up until now, season five had been slow, but admirably so. Kill the Boy fails to both continue strengthening the build up or advance the story in interesting ways. We're midway through this season now, and time is running thin for the writers to craft a satisfying conclusion to the countless arcs they set up in the first four episodes.",

                    "content": "A low-key episode all in all, but that doesn't mean to say that it didn't make an impression. Even in the quietest episodes, lots happen, and with characters making bold decisions, it seems that Season 5 is definitely in full swing. Funnily enough though, this is only the fourth episode ever not to feature King's Landing as one of its prime locations, the first, second and third being, the Kingsroad, the Rains of Castamere and the Watchers on the Wall. This just shows that we don't need the tensions in the capital city to make an episode enthralling.In the north, there were a number of great scenes. Most notably was Jon's conversation with Tormund. To free a man who once had so much hatred for Jon is quite a bold thing to do, and just shows that he is a superb Lord Commander, who is able to make those difficult decisions, to the detriment of consolidating a friendship with his fellow watchmen. He evidently did heed the Maester's words, which seemed to have changed Jon for the better. In addition, we got hear a bit more about the winter that's coming. Both Jon and Stannis are of the mind that the protection in the north is of paramount importance; Jon calling on Tormund to round up the Wildlings and Stannis calling on Samwell to understand a bit more about Dragonglass. This was a great way to get us excited about what is to come, because it's inevitable at this point that it will.In Winterfell, things are going nicely. I've never read the books so I cannot compare the plot developments, but the television adaption appeals to me. Sansa's discretion is the only thing that's saving her at the moment, but it's nice to see that she still got friends. But we also have the frightening Ramsay, played wonderfully by Iwan Rheon, attempting to transcend himself, much to Roose's dismay. His retelling of how Ramsay was born, however, was a definite character change, as we see Ramsay consider his own mortality. As a prediction (and I'm probably wrong), I have a feeling Myranda will have a greater role in future episodes, and will eventually attempt to kill Sansa, no matter the cost.In Meereen, Ser Barristan's death has been confirmed, but Grey Worm has survived! Currently at a loss of two advisers, Daenerys makes a rash decision to threaten the masters, in the hope of gaining their backing - but it's a snap decision that she regrets later. Thankfully, as a character who learns from hers and other's mistakes, Daenerys looks to the council of those around her, including Missandei, and she finally decides to open the fighting pits, and as a show of trust, marry Hizdahr zo Loraq. A surprising turn of events, but one that I can understand fully considering her circumstances. If she wants peace, she can only give the people what they want. Missandei's scene with Grey Worm was lovely too, with the Unsullied warrior confessing a crime that many people can admit to - it just shows how humane this series is.Finally in the south seas of Essos, now crossing through Valyria, Tyrion continues to talk aimlessly to Jorah Mormont, trying to free himself, to no avail. But things get really interesting when they pass through the \"doomed city\". Credit to the visual effects team, this was a sight to behold and more - and the final shot with Drogon flying overhead was purely magical. There was something really nostalgic about that poem the two men shared too, as it helps to expand the universe of Game of Thrones even further. The unexpected arrival of the Stone Men was certainly surprising, and I was anxious for neither character to be infected. But, as always in Game of Thrones, there are ultimate consequences, and just like the real world, nothing is fair, and nowhere is safe. Jorah's mortality is now in question.A suitably strong installment for the series, not as exciting as last week's, but definitely worthy of praise. Bryan Cogman has made some excellent contributions in the past, probably best known for the Laws of Gods and Men. Let's see if he can continue this trend for next week!8.3/10",

                    "content": "The first scene begins with Maester Aemon having Sam read about Danaerys' activities and he regrets not being there for her and instead being at the Wall. Jon comes in and seeks his counsel regarding the treaty with the wildlings, to which Aemon advises him to \"kill the boy and let the man be born\" - Jon should stand by his decisions and do what needs to be done. We see the Night's Watch strongly disagreeing with Jon's proposed actions. He makes a deal with Tormund, freeing him and agreeing to personally help settle the wildlings at Hardhorne in the North. In Meereen, Ser Barristan is dead after fighting the sneaky golden masks (The Sons of the Harpy). In the books he is shown to be alive and defending Meereen at the end of A Dance with Dragons (Book 5). Killing him was a risky move but is quite realistic, as even though an exceptional fighter, being old and wearing no armor and fighting guerrilla soldiers during an ambush the chances of survival are dim. However Grey Worm survives though heavily wounded. Danaerys makes a decision to have the heads of the noble families burned alive and eaten by her two dragons. This is quite confusing as the previous episode showed Barristan advising her to not become her father, the Mad King. Then she agrees to open the fighting pits and marry Hizadahr Loraq. In the books she keeps hostages from the noble families and only marries Hizadahr after he fulfills his 90 days promise of peace in Meereen. The episodes 4 and 5's pacing is really fast but quite inconsistent. in Winterfell Brienne and Podrick stay at an inn and recruit a man serving to the Boltons to help Sansa. Speaking of Sansa, the episode was pleasantly surprising in a good way. She is looking at the broken tower where her brother fell down and became a wolf boy when Myranda, Ramsay's lover urges her to explore the kennels for a surprise. She truly is, as she sees Theon scared and broken as Reek. At the dinner table with the Boltons, Ramsay reveals his true nature and tries to torture Sansa mentally like Joffrey by making Theon/Reek apologize to her for killing her brothers and declares Theon/Reek as her best man during their upcoming wedding as he is her foster brother. Sansa and Roose see through his bullshit and he and Fat Walda declare that a legitimate Bolton junior is arriving, pissing off Ramsay. Ramsay is angry at his father for this, but Roose knows how to handle his bastard and assures him that he is his son and reveals to him the truth about his birth, and convinces him to be ready and fight Stannis, who finally leaves the Wall with his family, Ser Davos, Melisandre and his army to fight at Winterfell. That aside, Jorah and Tyrion travel through Valyria, the Targaryen ancestral nation which is in ruins. Tryion and Jorah recite poetry and their pairing looks great (like Bronn and Tyrion with Jorah as the more serious and honorable version of Bronn). They witness a dragon flying (was it Drogon?) and are attacked by Stone men, the crazy greyscale infected who reside in the ruins of Valyria and Tyrion jumps in the water to avoid being touched and infected by them. We see him alive later with Jorah all soaking wet having rescued him but become infected himself (in the books it is Jon Connington who was Rhaegar's bestie who rescues Tyrion and is starting to become a stone man). Poor Jorah; from Lord Friendzone to Lord Stone Man...To recap:+ \"Kill the Boy\" speech by Maester Aemon. + The rise of the Northern Bastards: Jon Snow's treaty with Tormund and Ramsay now preparing for a fight with Stannis. + Dark Sansa who stands to Ramsay and his family. + Brienne still determined to protect Sansa. + Grey Worm and Melisandre's romance. + Jorah suffering from greyscale and its potential future impact.RIP Ser Barristan the Bold. - Inconsistent Danaerys.",

                    "content": "This episode has got to be a perfect proof of the deteriorating quality of Game of Thrones episodes lately. Why do I say that? Well, let's just start with how Dorne's story is unfolding. In the last few episodes, we see Oberyn's lover plotting with his daughters for revenge against the Lannisters. Knowing that it would culminate into a full blown confrontation between the duo from King's Landing and the Sand Snakes, we were hoping for an exhilarating fight to say the least and some irrevocable damage that was to be inflicted on the possibility of peace between the two clans (exemplified by Myrcella's scar in the book). Instead, what we got was some really badly orchestrated fight between the two factions and an absolutely anti-climatic end to all of the plotting. What was the whole point of this? It seems like the writers had only intended to drag the story on. Moving on to Winterfell, Sansa got ready for her big night and ends up out-witting a lowly servant girl in her attempts to unnerve her. Are we supposed to rejoice? Is this a victory? Is this the moment when Sansa finds her footing? That this scene would be the answer to these questions would be belittling the question itself. Sansa STARK would never have problems out- witting servants. Her problems have been far graver and her torturers truly powerful people, confronting whom would require not wit and contempt but true power and strength. When I realized that Sansa was to be Jeyne's substitute, I knew this scene would come and from the books I do know what's in store for Sansa is worse. Now the reason why I am unhappy with this scenario is because in the books, she has time and opportunity to gain strength and truly come onto her own. But here, she has yet again been reduced to a play-thing for perverts. Since she is again helpless against her tormentors,we are left to wondering when her rescuer would come to save her (maybe Brienne, Theon or whoever, but never herself) - a truly nauseating prospect. The show writers have clearly sacrificed Sansa's character growth for some cheap horror shots. Now why did I rate this revolting episode a 2 and not a 1 or 0 (not sure if 0 is an option)? Well that would be because of a few (precisely two) moments of redemption, like Tyrion thinking on his feet and Arya's lie. I am seriously reconsidering watching the series because of the bitter aftertaste left by this episode.",

                    "content": "More of a story building episode focused mainly on the happenings in the north and Essos. In Mereen : Barristan Selmy is dead and Grey worm in seriously injured (10 minutes of clich\u00e9 romance with Melissanda). Danerys council has grown small prompting her to capture leaders of the wise masters and using some scary dragon eating torture techniques. Advised by Melisande, she decides to go for a more political route choosing to betroth Hizdar and opening the fighting pits. All in all things are not really looking up for Danerys as she feels increasingly alone and has started to show signs of a true TargaryanAt the wall:Two important decisions taken. Stannis decides to move towards Winterfell and Jon is going with Tormund to bring the wild-lings south of the wall and protect them from the white walkers. Some side story aside on dragon glass and Sam. Occupies major part and the tag line of the episodeAt Winterfell: Ramsay is already starting his mental games with Sansa as he introduces Theon as reek and asks him to give the bride on their wedding. Roose Bolton announces the pregnancy of Walda Frey and which in turn leads to my favorite scene in the episode. As Ramsay discusses his future with Roose Bolton in lieu of this, Roose tells him about his mother who he raped on her wedding night beneath the hanging corpse of her husband. In the end, he saved Ramsay because he was his son. The dialog is delivered with amazing effect and enforces Roose Bolton as another of those awesome Grey characters like Tywin & Stannis.Tyrion: Jorah and Tyrion take a shortcut through the ruins of Valaryia and get attacked by stone men. Jorah get infected with grey-scale while saving Tyrion. This is the most eye catching part of the episode in terms of exploring a new location. The ancient ruins of Valaryia look fabulous and you can really feel yourself in the lost city. A brief sighting of Drogon adds flavor to this well shot scene making it one of the best scenic shots in the entire season so far.The episode is worth watching mainly for the machinations of Roose Bolton and catching a glimpse of ValayriaCheers",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" is one of the most polarising 'Game of Thrones' episodes and is considered by some fans a lesser episode, also the one with the lowest Rotten Tomatoes rating. Can definitely see why \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" is not liked by fans and understand the criticisms, but count me in as someone leaning towards the \"liked it\" camp. Won't passionately defend it, because it is not a perfect episode and one of the weaker ones of Season 5 and of the show up to this point for me, but it's better than given credit for and has a lot to like. The very controversial final scene, in the top five perhaps of the most controversial scenes in 'Game of Thrones' history, has been much talked about, with some defending it and giving very passionate interpretations (feasible too) as to why it works and others finding it distasteful. Personally was not offended by it and that, while hard to watch and the shock value did veer towards being taken too far (even for 'Game of Thrones', no stranger to shocking violent scenes), the controversy to me has been blown out of proportion somewhat and it doesn't undermine the characters that much. Did feel though that it did feel out of place in the episode dramatically and tonally and didn't add very much other than to make Ramsay more despicable.Actually though, \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" was at its weakest in the stuff with the Sand Snakes, where some unusually sloppy writing can be found and the action is also uncharacteristically clumsy and lacking in tension and thrills. It is a shame that that is the case, because everything else in \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" is done really well. Some may find that nothing new is done with the characters and that things aren't moved forward. Personally while other episodes do these aspects better, Littlefinger (especially awesome here) and Arya's developments add a good deal. Furthermore, Sansa is the most interesting she's been all season up to this point and the episode actually did the impossible and made me see Theon in a different light at the end. The King's Landing scenes are intriguing and suspenseful, everything with Tyrion is very entertaining and it is hard not to relate to Arya. A lot happens in the episode and most of it has tension, fun and insight. 'Game of Thrones' always delivers on the acting, and Peter Dinklage and Aiden Gillen are especially good here, Dinklage has great timing and so much fun to watch while having a few moments of drama and Gillen embodies slimy creepiness.Visually, \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Script-wise, the episode is inconsistent with the Sand Snakes writing badly messed up but the humour, mystery, wide emotional ranges and thought-provoking layers are present pretty much everywhere else. There is a lot of passion and sensitivity in most of the storytelling, and it's nicely paced.Overall, a little disappointing but a polarising episode that mostly impressed me. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The material with Arya feels stretched out endlessly although the High Sparrow scenes are still fun at this point. Iain Glen just about saves things, and there's a world of difference between his scenes and those in Dorne, where suddenly cheesy dialogue, bad one-liners and some incredibly wooden acting from the younger cast members seem awfully out of place.",

Tyrion is no at the mercy of slave traders and Jorah is infected. Both are in about as tenuous situation as there can be. Cersei has embraced the Sparrows and has taken on Margery full force, having her cast into prison. She is still ruling the kingdom and Tommen is just a little boy, hopelessly out of his league. Theon still has a bit of nobility in him (though he always was a coward) and may have been pushed to the brink. Sansa has been given to Ramsay and he is doing what he always does. He is a delightfully awful character whom we grow to hate with each passing minute. Then there is the princess who has embraced her new life in a far off land and has fallen in love with a suitor. She is going to be hard to rescue, since her saviors are now captured and she is so resistant to being rescued. With Circei back home, one can only imagine. Also, Littlefinger has made a packed with the evil queen mother for his own gain. She is putting a lot of eggs in his basket. The closing scene is terrifying, but only because of the buildup. So many have suffered throughout this story, so Sansa is not going to walk through everything unscathed. Can't wait for the next episode.",

Sansa marries Ramsay Bolton and he humiliates her. \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" is one of the weakest episodes of \"Game of Thrones\". Arya used to be one of my favorite characters; however her segment in the House of Black and white is boring. Little Finger is annoying with Machiavellian schemes against everyone that is powerful making the viewer lost about his true intentions. Cersei's plots are also annoying. I did not read the book, but the last scene with the humiliation of Sansa by Ramsay seems to be totally unnecessary. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\"",

                    "content": "After a two episode absence we get to see Arya Stark again; weeks have passed and she is still spending her time preparing the bodies of the dead and sweeping the floor. She claims to be ready to progress in her training so Jaqen H'ghar asks her to tell him who she is and who she came to be there; each time he catches her in a lie he strikes her. Another test comes when a young girl is brought to the House of Black and White; she suffers from an incurable condition and can only hope for a comfortable death; it is up to Arya to make it as easy for her as possible; telling her what she needs to hear not what is actually true. Elsewhere in Essos Tyrion and Jorah Mormont continue their journey but are captured by a group of slavers' it is only Tyrion's quick talking that saves his life and persuades their captors not to take them in the wrong direction.Back in Westeros Sansa is warned of what happens to women who bore Ramsey Bolton. Later her wedding takes place and her wedding night is anything but romantic. In the capital Lord Baelish informs Cersei that Sansa is at Winterfell and tells her that once Stannis and Lord Bolton have fought it out he will have the Knights of the Vale attack the victor\u0085 on condition that Warden of the North. Later Olenna Tyrell arrives demanding the release of her son but after a brief enquiry Margaery is taken into custody as well; accused of giving false testimony. In Dorne Jaime and Bronn find Myrcella but are immediately attacked by a group of women known as the Sand Snakes.I was rather shocked to see so many one star reviews for this episode as I really enjoyed it. The opening where Arya washed the corpses may not have been exciting but there was a tenderness that made it a joy to watch. Her story progressed nicely with Maisie Williams once again putting in a fine performance. As usual Peter Dinklage does a great job as Tyrion; especially as he pleads for his life. The scenes featuring Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark were some of the most disturbing in the series; especially after her wedding when she is raped by Ramsey; he is one of the series' least pleasant characters by some way and this final scene was a gruelling watch. The goings on in King's Landing were intriguing; Lord Baelish is as conniving as ever and the treatment of the Tyrell's is sure to have repercussions later in the series. Overall another fine episode.",

And for the most part, it exemplified strong character moments for all of our favorite female characters. It turned out to be one of if not the best episode of the season so far. Game of Thrones has always been great at giving us backstabbing moments that actually make sense and don't feel forced, and I feel like this was a perfect example of an episode that focused on it. Plus, this episode definitely felt like the first step into the absolute chaotic second half of the season.We began in Braavos where Arya continued her training into becoming no one. Even though Arya has probably had the least amount of screen-time out of the main cast members this year, her scenes at the House of Black and White have felt tedious. With that being said, the dungeon of heads or whatever was pretty cool. And I was glad to see that it seems as though her training is picking up a bit. Speaking of the Starks, Sansa had a big night, but not necessarily a good one. Anytime the show has a wedding, I get nervous for the characters. I half expected to Brienne to break up the party, or maybe even Theon. But what I was really hoping for was Theon killing Ramsay while he raped Sansa. It was heartbreaking watching Sansa go through something like that after all she has been through, and Theon's face seemed to signal him helping her. But she did have a great scene with Myranda in which she completely out smarted her and I'm sure eventually will prove that she will not be one of those 'dumb girls'.Baelish arrived at Kings Landing to set another one of his schemes in motion. When he revealed to Cersei that Sansa was still alive, I thought for a second that he had bad intentions but in typical Baelish form, he had more up his sleeve. This time he wants to be named Warden of the North. That's something I would be okay with, as long as the Bolton's get what they deserve. Meanwhile, Cersei once again plotted against Margaery. It's been fun all season watching the two go at matching blows week to week. Putting her on trial with her brother for having homosexual experiences is pretty brutal. And it shows us again just how little power Tommen actually has.Onto our favorite road trip duos, Tyrion and Jorah bonded over their father issues, that is until they were captured by slavers. I feel like the whole being 'captured on a road trip' thing is getting a bit annoying but at least the slavers are headed towards Meereen. If anything else, tonight was a great episode for these two and their scenes erase the brutal final scene. Where's Varys when we need him? Jaimie and Bronn arrived but ended up in a battle with the strange sand snakes. Bronn was another character I thought may kick the bucket tonight, thankfully he did not, and gave us the hilarious 'oh for fuc** sake line'. So now being over half way through the season, I'm very excited to see how the season ends. And hopefully the show delivers on many of the promises it's seemingly making.+Road trip duos +Cersei vs Margaery +Baelish plots again +Bronn +Arya getting closer -Theon should have redeemed himself -I felt Dany's absence 9.1/10",

Episedes 5 and 6 were both worth 8/10 in my opinion, which is kinda disappointing if you compare this season to a mesmerizing season 4.Story moves on, not arriving to payoffs yet. As i guessed already couple of episodes before, this season in more of building up a story, with nothing that much happening. Sure, as usual these last two episodes had great set design, costumes, good acting, but nothing so far that would make us jaws dropped. Episode 6 is just a prof of that - 53 min. and it's kinda interesting, but feels not that good. Now the things moved a bit further to a payoff, but yet again, i want' siting on the edge of seat during them, and that is a bit of a letdown compared to a previous seasons, where anything and anytime could happen.Overall, episode 5 and 6 were good, but far from great. Story moves on, but something here is missing. I truly believe that following episodes will revive that unforgettable feeling of uncertain in \"Game of Thrones\", but so far previous episodes lacked it.",

The ordeal is vague and puzzling, she might not even know what the reward would grant her, but the show effectively draws some sympathy in her expense. Maisie Williams has perfected the character look of a girl putting brave front yet in need of serious hug. Honestly, most audience would want her to be safe and happy.Two men take their respective journey to recover the woman they love, while accompanied by a peculiar friend. Neither of them finds much success. Jorah and Tyrion are surprisingly a good match, delivering banters along the way. They are both at the low point of their lives and things are not looking good, but serendipitously this might be the most lively Tyrion has even been this season.Jamie ventures deeper into Dorne and straight into scene of Romeo and Juliet. It's been a long shot anyway, infiltrating enemy land and securing captive princess while both of them are far from stealthy. The most notable cultural difference is warrior as an actual occupation for ladies. It's a certainly nice change of pace from typical burly men in thick armor and opens up more diverse choreography.The latter part of this episode is rather unsettling, it showcases old hidden union and a new one. Cersei's political maneuvering continues with incredibly private matter. Much like war it's crucial to not aim one's sword at forbidden target. This is a wicked tactic, and especially more so since Cersei has the same escapades of liable nature.The show has given audience many views of bare skins, one would think when Sansa finally bares hers, it would be somewhat delightful. It is not, not in the slightest. The episode opens with hope given to Arya and ends with hope taken from Sansa.At the very least it holds promise of grandeur for next episode, with glorious fighting, cock merchant and all.",

                    "content": "Suffice to say that when GOT cuts down on the excess and decides to focus on a few major story lines it's a much more easy episode to follow. No sign of or Dany or Brienne this week (not that she's actually up to much) and at last we get some action in Dorne, although Alexander Siddig still has not yet truly shown what Doran is capable of. But first we start with Arya and the continued game of puzzles and ambiguity that has gotten her and some of the audience visibly frustrated. It seems to be conflicting messages that the House of Black and White and it's associates are giving off here. The ultimate goal of achieving \"no one\" and becoming a Faceless Man is no more closer for Arya as she still reminiscences on her Stark past even though she hasn't seen Winterfell for so long or known what it's become. But she is ready to become some one else? The stringent criteria for the assassin's league seems to be flexible enough to let our bad-ass female protagonist in early than her other washing friend. What's done really well is the wall of faces which in the television format becomes a enormous room. Not often do we get such sheer scale even with the increasing budget but the team pulls it off well. No crazy jump scare as she touches the face our a loud gasp. The scene lets the lighting and the eerie soundtrack work together with Arya's reaction to the sacred vault. It's a big step for her storyline. Elsewhere Jorah and Tyrion are slowly but surely making their way to Meereen. It looks a lot more like Westeros than Essos but the scenery is gorgeous either way. The fast talking son of Tywin Lannister again shows his wit like in so many previous scenarios where a person of his stature would fail. Thanks to some very easily convinced salvers we now sail to Meereen where Jorah will hope to find some redemption, not as an adviser, but a pit fighter. But will it be enough to sway Dany?It's nice to be greeted by some Westeros culture as Bronn rides into sight of the Water Gardens singing The Dornishman's Wife. It really creates a sense of a living breathing world and why wouldn't you use the lovely voice of Jerome Flynn, the 90s pop star? He's already starred in that great scene with the drunk Lannister soldiers just before the Battle of Blackwater, singing that fateful song. His voice is probably the best part of this segment however, as we descend into a very fortuitous fight scene which reeks of the same problems as the fateful fight in Meereen two weeks ago. I've already talked about how utterly plain and indistinguishable the Sand Snakes are from one another and this scene makes it seem like the only thing that separates them is their choice of weapons. The choreography attempts to copy the flashy bravado nature of Oberyn's Trial by combat but falls flat in a series of rapid jarring cuts which speed up their hand movements and slow down their footsteps to remove any sense of urgency in the scene that the music suggests. And what now, after 2 of the Sand Snakes, both Jaime and Bronn and Ellaria have been captured? It will be interesting to see Doran's judgement but what will the escaping Sand Snake (the one with the whip) and Myrcella do without any outside guidance or a plan which vaguely speaks of 'war'? In King's Landing we see the eager return of Diana Rigg as perhaps one of the only capable people in the city, Olenna Tyrell. The trial is very well done and even manages to make a callback to the birthmark conversation that I had previously earmarked as irrelevant. Of course it's Loras' reaction and not that which eventually gives him away. The whims of Cersei have awoken a very dangerous beast in the Faith Militant although it remains to be seen how exactly it will bite her in the back. After all, incest is as detested in Westeros as homosexuality. And in the Faith they have a very dependable new witness. Finally we end on Sansa's new development, her marriage to Ramsay Bolton. The forced consummation is a very sudden change for her character who has been supposedly built up throughout this and last season as strong, independent and intelligent. Even a few minutes before the ending we get her snapping at Myranda for her scare tactics and putting up a brave attitude towards the whole affair. Ramsay rips right through the whole thing as if it was a facade. The troubling thing is that Littlefinger knew exactly this was to happen and yet lets it go quite easily. Where is his supposed love for Sansa that manifested from his childhood crush on Cat? He's not the easiest character to understand but his actions in this season have been baffling to say the least. If all it takes is a short conversation to convince Cersei of the Bolton's double cross then why set up the whole thing in the first place? Or why even bother going for the North when he is already Lord Protector of the Vale, Lord of Harrenhal and has a hold on the young Warden of the East? Why leave the impenetrable Eyrie and place his prized possession in the hands of a house notorious for betrayal and flaying? It's all a very mysterious act which begs for an answer as we cross the halfway path in this season.",

What's worse it that it received a 58% rating on Rottentomatoes. Ouch. However, I think that this is a pretty good episode. But before I can give it some praise, there are some problems I have with it.In the previous episodes, the dialog was mostly good despite how slow the plot progression has gotten, but it's sad to say that the dialog here is really weak. It came across as too violent and disturbing particularly the ending sequence where Ramsay Bolton rapes Sansa Stark which came across as really unnecessary (which was the only reason why it received such controversy) and made me felt sorry for her. The second and third problems are the script and plot progression. The script does have some fine moments, but it lacks the spark that made the previous episodes (not to mention the previous seasons) so great. Also, the story did little to advance the story-arcs for the Lannister and Stark characters.However, despite those flaws, everything else turned out OK. The performances, despite how weak the dialog was, are still good, the scenery, sets and costumes are still gorgeous, the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still fabulous and suited the atmospheric tone in some of the scenes really well, the directing is really good, and the editing is even more sharper this time around.So, overall, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken is by far the weakest episode of the entire season, but in spite of it's problems, it's still pretty good. :)",

Until this episode the show perfectly skated the edge of shock, camp & horror to deliver a wonderfully tantalising slice of entertainment. Nevertheless this episode betrayed the credibility Game Of Thrones has so far masterfully held. Of course I'm talking about the Sansa rape-scene.Here's why it was shock for shock sake, ergo betraying any artistic integrity: Game Of Thrones is fantasy, but all fantasy must reflect reality in order to allow access, a gateway into the story. The viewer will associate with strong male & female characters, heroes which drag us along. Now, for females Sansa was most definitely one of those characters, having survived horrors; mentally & physically intact. A surviving beautiful women (not a sexual victim) in a world where there are too few. Once again, an inspiration for the female fans.The Rape Of Sansa, I suspect, was written by a man as it stank of misogyny. It whiffed of an evil frat-boy's wet dream. I half expected 'sponsored by rohypnol' to flash up on the screen. The problem Game Of Thrones has, is that this storyline is now an integral part of the show. The reaction to Sansa's rape by the female fan community is clear evidence of the extraordinarily poor judgement executed. N.B. It's important to note that this storyline is not that of George RR Martin.Who the hell enjoyed this? It simply turned my stomach, ejected me from the fantasy & left me incredibly disappointed. If this is the non George RR Martin Game Of Thrones, I want nothing to do with it.What does this tell women? Doesn't matter what you do or who you are, you're gunna get f**ked!",

                    "content": "After a middling installment last week, Game of Thrones' fifth season is back on track and the momentum is moving again. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken is arguably the most eventful episode of the season yet: Ramsay and Sansa married; the Faith Militant arrested the Queen of Westeros; Arya finally made real progress in her training; Jaime briefly relocated his daughter in Dorne and the Sand Snakes attacked. But episode six also returned to the style of the first four episodes by having a solid theme run through each of the narrative arcs. Whereas last week's Kill the Boy failed to offer a strong thematic link between its uneventful narratives, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken displayed something quite simple: honesty.This theme is most present in Arya's outing this week, in which she learns that there is a lot more to becoming no-one that she previously envisioned. \"Did you believe a word I said?\", the Waif asks Arya, \"Was I telling the truth or was I lying?\". This brief encounter visibly shakes Arya, leading to potentially her best scene of the season yet. As Jaqen H'Ghar quizzes her on her former life, striking her down every time she lies, we come to learn a lot more about Arya than we did before; despite everything she attempted to make him believe, she never hated the Hound. This theme also resonates clearly in Loras' trial, in which he and his sister, Queen Margaery, lie repeatedly, only to result in both of their arrests. It may not compare to the trial we saw in last season's episode six, in which Tyrion took down the entirety of the upper class of King's Landing, but it's a terrific sequence nonetheless; any moment involving Lena Headey, Natalie Dormer and Diana Rigg in the same scene is bound to steal the episode.The episode's most resonating scene, though, comes at the very close. Game of Thrones has always been controversial in its depiction of sexual violence, and has (on more than one occasion) adapted a consensual sex scene from the source novels into a rape sequence for the show. Whilst Sansa's rape at the end of the episode isn't adapted from a consensual moment in the novel (it isn't in the novel at all, in fact) it still feels morbidly unnecessary. It's a tonally dark sequence, as Ramsay forces Reek to watch as \"the girl he grew up with becomes a woman\", and undoubtedly the most disturbing thing we've been given all season. But, for some reason, the whole scene fails to feel justified. Myranda essentially informs Sansa, and the audience, what will happen after the wedding, so the viewer is well aware of the ordeal Sansa will endure that night. I feel the outcome of this would hit harder if we hadn't seen it, and had rather caught up with Sansa at the beginning of next week's episode. Unless, perhaps, the show is prepared to delve into this deeper and uncover the more psychological motivations and impacts of the moment, but this seems unlikely. Otherwise, it feels like yet another mere exploitation for simple shock value, only reconfirmed by the writers' decision to use Sansa's rape as the episodes conclusion. Absent this week was Daenerys, as well as Jon Snow and Stannis Baratheon, ultimately allowing more time to be fleshed out with the stories we were offered. Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken benefits from being the most eventful episode of the season thus far, and its thematic umbrellas of truth, deceit and honesty gives the episode a nice focus that was lacking last week. But it's bogged down by something I thought the show was long past by now and, regrettably, whilst the stories are finally advancing, nothing is looking anywhere close to a satisfying conclusion with just four episodes to go. We know the show will return next year, and every year until the story is finished, but season five is unfortunately looking set to be the show's weakest year thus far. It is rich thematically and remains fantastically written and superbly performed, but the narrative hold seems to be dropping, and I'm unsure how much longer the show can survive on setup.",

                    "content": "After reading some very negative reviews on what can surely only be called the greatest episode of the season so far, I feel compelled to write my own review to demonstrate what makes this episode stand out to me.First of all, last week's episode was fairly uneventful, therefore when this week's episode aired it should have been unanimously praised. However, many viewers are claiming that this episode was \"one of the worst episodes of GOT\", \"poorly done\", and \"terrible\" - did we watch the same episode?!Okay, sure: the fight scene between the Sand Snakes and Jaime and Bronn seemed clumsy as certainly someone should have died (*cough cough* the one-handed-Jaime *cough cough*), yet I was sitting on the edge of my seat fearing for the loss of any of the characters as I want to see them all survive (despite the fact that inevitably they cannot all possibly), therefore when the fight was intervened I let out a sigh of relief knowing that everyone was safe - for the time being.But what annoys me the most is the fact that it is the final scene which people are condemning and berating the writers for. This is absolutely ludicrous. Yes, Sansa has been through hell from the beginning, and as of recent she has been beginning to gain some authority and power so to see it all wiped away in this rape scene is tragic. But is it really that hard to fathom? We're talking about Ramsay Snow (or Bolton - whatever): the most sickening, evil cretin of a human being in all of Westeros. We have witnessed him viciously mutilating people in the past - indeed, a victim happens to be in the same room as them! - so is it really that horrific that he did as he has always done to Sansa? No! Of course it's not! It is entirely logical and whilst it is upsetting to see Sansa, a character we want to see succeed after having gone through so much, being raped, it is the only thing that would have made sense in this scene. And looking to the future, we can only yearn for the day that Ramsay gets what's coming to him. Whether that be by the hand of Brienne, Stannis, Sansa herself, or perhaps even Theon (unlikely, I believe), it will be a fine episode to look forward to.In addition, do remember that in the very first season Daenerys was brutally raped by Khal Drogo and in that scene they showed far more than they did in Sansa's scene in this episode - so why is this episode being criticised so much more?This episode was stellar: Arya begins making some serious progress in the House of Black and White and we learn what all the bodies are cleaned for; Tyrion and Jorah are captured by pirates; Littlefinger swears loyalty to the King and perhaps sets up some serious chaos for future episodes; the Sand Snakes and Jaime and Bronn all close in on Myrcella; Lady Olenna and Queen-Mother Cersei have their polite conversation of (un)veiled threats; Margaery and Loras are arrested as King Tommen sits helplessly and watches in horror; and Ramsay and Sansa begin their wretched relationship together. If last week's episode was lacking, then this week's episode was a gift and should be unanimously praised. This was by far the most action-packed, thrilling and exciting episode of the season, yet it was also the most emotionally manipulative. For that, this is my favourite episode of season 5 thus far. I do sincerely hope the rest of the season delivers and continues with the momentum of this episode.",

                    "content": "We are well into the 6th episode of season 5th and just like last season 4; its just dragging on, as one review pointed out that its going no where. Each episodes is filled with mostly irrelevant scenes that are scene fillers with Characters like \"Samwell Tarly\" that are irrelevant to overall story compare to Stark children such as Bran Stark whom is missing this season. This show has become so predictable in its pattern of how the hour episode is filled with mundane characters such as tonight's High sparrow Kangroo court that serve no purpose in moving the story forward. Even Arya Stark, who is one of the main characters, in 3 episodes in the Black and White house is become so vague; we are still clueless as to what is the purpose of her so-called training. Jaqen H'ghar who was a very enigmatic character in the second season has now only returned to say very little, his character is like a walking robot, it has lost its enigma. Each episode always ends in some shocking turn of events just in the last ten minutes, be it a blood bath wedding, a hand getting chopped off, Sansa getting raped last night, which was utterly distasteful and a cheap shot. So when the show ends you sit back and kind of left in a weird trans or maybe even little disturbed, but you ponder in wonder, even hope that something will change next time but only to tune in next week for the same pattern of irrelevance that keeps this show alive and high rated on HBO.. Just like the character \"Baelish\" aka: Little Finger, HBO is another form of peddler of Entertainment. The producers and the so-called screen writers of this show kind of mirror the very cast of this show, like little Finger who will twist and turn the truth to serve his agenda. HBO and creators have ironically done the same to tell the story of these books, its their own Game of chaos, to use shock value and cruelty to be their main source of stock. In five seasons darkness and cruelty seems to be on the rise in more sicker characters like \"Ramsey\",you begin to ask yourself what's the purpose of watching this show?. is this series an anthology on evil and cruelty?. that there is not much light or glimmer of hope in this tunnel of darkness where people like Sansa experience more cruelty in five years since her parent's death. HBO knows they got a hooked audience who will watch every episode to see how much sicker and crueler it can get, so no matter how boring, how sick, how bloody, how far departed from what actual books of George R.R. Martin were written, only to manipulate the audience with scenes like Sansa rape scene with the monster sick Ramsey. The more ignorant you are of the books the more to the advantage of the producers because so far they have butchered so much of the books that they are almost writing a new version of their own. Just wait until the last 3 episodes when you suddenly see a shift in the story line, where you may actually see some revenge for the Stark family, like last Season the death of the two Lanisters getting killed only towards the end of the season; that's all part of the game to lead us into the next season. The producers and HBO have become great at this game, to give us very little in 10 episodes and that pattern to lead you right to a bogus cliff hanger of final episode and how to end this another mundane season only to make you wait another full year to peddle more irrelevant characters. This is all for their own purpose to stretch and milk these series as long as they can even if it goes no where but we will all follow like a heard of sheep. It's good that we as an audience can come here on IMDb to express our opinions, some of you or most of you may read mine and get upset and think I am being negative, and think so what if they do stretch it, etc. But the truth is I use to love this show and now I feel almost contempt for what the producers have done to it to cheat the audience by wasting time. I wish there more criticism on a larger scale from the media. I think last night's episode is where it really crossed the line with Sansa's rape scene, it was the sickest and most cruelest scene in the entire five season even above the blood bath wedding. I also had very sick feeling after it was over to reconsider to stop watching this show?.",

                    "content": "This episode finally establishes that while many characters follow the storyline from the books although with slight changes (due to TV as a medium), others have completely different story lines. Waiting eagerly for the next episode.Arya continues her training at the House of Black and White as she fails again at her test, but then later learns to lie successfully and kill someone without being emotional, passing the first of her many trials and is introduced to the collection of dead faces in the basement. Readers know what her future holds. Viewers, wait for a surprise.Meanwhile Jorah and Tyrion roam around and talk (Tyrion does, until Jorah tells him to shut up). Their chemistry is superb, not unlike Tyrion and Bronn. The conversation changes to fathers, and Tyrion tells Jorah the reason he is here and accidentally reveals to Jorah that his father died while leading an expedition beyond the Wall due to mutiny. Jorah gets emotional. They are captured by slavers and Tyrion uses his wit and loud mouth to save his cock from being cut off and sold to a cock merchant and convinces them to let Jorah fight in the pits in Meereen which Danaerys has reopened. We know Jorah is going to kick ass based to the released Season 5 photos. Talk about luck...... Speaking of Bronn, we are treated to his wonderful rendition of \"The Dornishman's Wife\", a famous song in Westeros, as Jerome Flynn gets to flex his singing muscles again (He was the half of the hit duo Robson and Jerome in the 90s). Reaching the Water Garden Jaime urges Myrcella to leave with him, but the Sand Snakes attack and attempt to take her hostage. The fight is very clumsy - they seriously can't defeat a sell sword and a one handed man?! Also bad cinematography and editing, as the camera angles are very shaky and there are too many cuts making it difficult to see who is fighting who.Fortunately Doran Martell anticipated this and has his Captain/Head of Security Areo Hotah stop the fight and capture them and also Ellaria Sand who gave such orders to the Sand Snakes.The Sand Snakes are really... Boring. They are indistinguishable from each other and they overact a lot as angry bloodthirsty women who want to avenge their father. And they can't fight! Oberyn would've killed Jaime and Bronn within seconds (I know he died in the trial by combat but he would've killed the Mountain if he wasn't stuck on drawing out his confession).Meanwhile Petyr Baelish aka Littlefinger returns to King's Landing and is interrupted by Brother Lancel \"I'm no Lannister\" who is now a religious fanatic with a flower marking on his head and surprisingly a brunette this season (never noticed it before). Their face-off is funny with Littlefinger calling his indulgences \"entertaining\" compared to Lancel's.During the meeting with Cersei, Littlefinger pledges his support to her and reveals that Sansa Stark is alive and is about to marry Ramsay Bolton while conveniently neglecting to state that he smuggled Sansa to the Boltons. What exactly is he planning? Does he have a fetish for chaos and disorder just like the Joker from The Dark Knight? Because chaos is a ladder? Sansa...oh my dear Sansa. Why? Didn't she suffer enough with Joffrey and Cersei...The hyped up nude bath scene was nothing much but we see Sansa standing up to Myranda who tries to intimidate her as she reveals Ramsay's true nature. For a while we feel good that Sansa is all grown up...... Until it comes crashing down as Ramsay tears up Sansa's clothes and violently rapes her and makes Theon/Reek watch on their wedding night. Theon's/Reek's expressions are heartbreaking and Alfie Allen deserves an Emmy for his portrayal of such a tragic character. Sansa now needs Brienne more than ever...+ Arya continues her training. + Jerome Flynn singing. + Tyrion and Jorah still going to Meereen. + Smart Doran. + There is a profession such as \"cock merchant\" in the world of GOT.Corny and unskilled Sand Snakes. They can't fight a one handed man and a sell sword and mouth off cheesy lines. They need better writing. - WTF ending. Even if we knew that the marriage wasn't going to be a happy one. - What exactly is Littlefinger's real motive? Chaos is a ladder?",

                    "content": "I have the benefit of hind sight in regard to the series since I binged the whole thing before the start of season 7. Because I binged the whole show in a week there was nothing that really stood out that justified this being rated as the show's worst episode. Many people hate the episode because of dorne and sansa getting raped and gave the whole thing 1 star because of it. Lets look at each subplot of this episode to see if the 1 star ratings are justified deserved.Tyrion and Jorah: We get a great moment where tyrion and Jorah talk about Jorah's father. There is also some entertaining banter between the two of them before they are captured by slavers. We get another great moment where tyrion escapes death by talking his way out of it.Arya: Arya plays the game of faces and is forced to accept that she doesn;t hate the hound any more. The scene where she successfully lies to the girl about the poison and the reveal of the hall of faces were also very impressiveKingslanding: We see yet another example of how Littlefinger is the best player of the game. There is also a great moment between Olenna and Cersei. Finally in a shocking twist both Loras and Margaery are arrested by the faith. Cersei's Plan seems to be working perfectly. (The High Sparrow is easily the best of the new characters that were introduced this season.Winterfell: Sansa stands up for herself against Ramsay's insane girlfriend. The wedding ceremony was very well done. And now for the rape scene. Is it disturbing? Yes. Is it horrible that Sansa had to suffer even more? Yes? Did we already know how horrible Ramsay was? Yes. However, Sansa didn't know. It was perfectly in Ramsay's character to do something horrible like that and its even worse in the books. Not to mention that now Sansa realizes she can't just blindly trust Littlefinger. He threw her into a horrible situation and did't know better. Those saying that the show runners didn't care about Sansa's pain during the scene were proven wrong in Season 6 when SPOILERSansa confronts Littlefinger about what happened and describes how she can still feel what happened. The scene was done as tastefully as possible and the way Sansa described the scene in season 6 is something I've never heard before in any movie or tv show yet it also sounds very realistic. Sansa's suffering in king's landing helped her in becoming less naive in regards to princes and queens while her suffering in winterfell helped her become less naive about Littlefinger. This episode also starts Reek/Theon on a path to redemption. Dorne: Yeah okay this was really bad. The sand snakes are horrible characters and the fight choreography and editing was terrible. To this date this was the worst action scene in the showIn conclusion, 4 of 5 story lines were great while 1 wasn't which equals 8 out of 10 stars. Even if I thought the winterfell plot was bad this episode that would be 6 or 7 stars. The worst episode of the show is not Unbowed Unbent Unbroken, it's season 7 episode 6 Beyond the Wall",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Personally liked to loved all the previous episodes of Season 5, which judging from the negative comments for the previous episode \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" doesn't seem to be a popular opinion. Up to this point however, \"The Gift\" is the best and a big improvement over the polarising (and to me well done episode hampered by the stuff with the Sand Snakes) \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\".What are the reasons for my saying this? It's the tightest paced episode up to this point in Season 5, it's the most jam-packed (in a good way, a lot happens but it doesn't feel too much), long awaited answers are provided and the character and story development show the most signs compared to the previous Season 5 episodes of moving forward rather than reiterating or feeling like filler. \"The Gift\" and \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" as well deserve credit for making Sansa the most interesting she's been in a long time and making me see Theon in a different light, instead of being the nasty piece of work he was previously part of me felt for him. There is a lot of intrigue and suspense, Tyrion and Jorah's storyline is very entertaining and the action is neatly executed. Actually found myself emotionally invested and interested in the Dorne storyline and the nudity in the prison scene was a non-issue.'Game of Thrones' always delivers on the acting. \"The Gift\" is no exception and can find no casting issues. Peter Dinklage, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Diana Rigg are particularly exemplary.Visually, \"The Gift\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Gift\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Script-wise, throughout the humour, mystery, wide emotional ranges and thought-provoking layers are present and the storytelling is passionate and sensitive. Overall, wonderful episode and one of Season 5's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The step downs are an openly pornographic scene in the cells with the awful Dorne daughters and a gratuitous bed scene with Daenerys. The arena fight scene comes on suddenly and unexpectedly and reaffirms what we already knew about Ser Jorah and his fighting abilities, a real burst of adrenaline, this one. The final scene with Cersei is possibly the most satisfying of the whole show, and the most satisfaction we've had since the days of Tyrion destroying Joffrey. I admit to getting small pleasure out of Sam's humiliation, which humanises a character previously indestructible to anyone and everything.",

We begin with John Snow leading men into battle. While he is in command technically, loyalty is at a premium and he must watch his back. Sam wishes him well. Gully's assault brings Sam to exert himself. He reaches a \"fight or die\" conclusion, even though he has few of the tools to manage. Ramsay continues to persecute Sansa and Theon still lives in fear. Of course, at work are a couple of things. The birth of a non-bastard son in the offing and his self proclaimed status in the kingdom. He has delusions of grandeur that are going to be put to the test at some point. Jorah and Tyrion are sold as slaves to fight in an arena. Dany allows this fight to go ahead to appease the wish for tradition in her current setting. Jorah is wishing to reclaim himself, but when he stands before her, she rejects him. But then she is given a gift. We also have action back at the castle as Cersei is playing her hand. Margery and her brother are in prison, kept in a horrible dungeon. Cersei believes the High Sparrow is her ally. Margery's mother confronts the High Sparrow and makes threats unless Margery is released. The child King, Tommen is wrapped around his mother's finger, thinking she has Margery's best interest in mind. Cersei, of course, is pure evil and smugly thinks that she is in control. The episode ends with one of the best scenes in the entire series.",

Sansa is in an even more precarious position in Winterfell; locked up during the day and at the mercy of Ramsey Bolton's perverse whims during the night; she seeks help from Theon but will this broken man be able to help her? Elsewhere in the north Stannis's army are held up in the snow; Lord Davos suggests that they return to Castle Black but Stannis is adamant that they continue to Winterfell; whether in victory or defeat he is determined that their campaign continues.In the capital Olenna Tyrell goes to see High Sparrow but finds that he can't be persuaded to release her grandchildren. The King is also determined to see Margaery released and his mother, Cersei, agrees to try to help\u0085 of course she has no such intentions and visits Margaery just to taunt her. This doesn't mean things go her way; she may be trying to use the High Sparrow and his followers but their motives are very different and she is playing a dangerous game without even knowing it. Further south, in Dorne, Jaime learns that his daughter has no intention of returning to King's Landing and Bronn has a talk with the Sand Snakes in the dungeons. Across the Narrow Sea in Essos Tyrion and Jorah Mormont are sold as slaves to fight in the pits\u0085 this leads to an unexpected meeting between Jorah and Daenerys.This was another really good episode with plenty of tension; some interesting plot developments and a nice twist involving Cersei and High Sparrow. The opening scenes snow us that winter is definitely coming in the North as snow falls on both Castle Black and Winterfell. The mood is almost as cold as we see Sam and Gilly's situation get distinctly more dangerous, even if that does bring them closer together, and things are even worse for Sansa as she learns that her situation is worse than she thought; she may have friends in the north but she has no way of contacting them; the one person she thought could help her is far too broken. Sophie Turner and Alfie Allen did fine jobs as Sansa and Theon. The scenes featuring Peter Dinklage and Iain Glen, as Tyrion and Jorah Mormont continue to some of the series more light-hearted moments\u0085 although they also provide some of the best action when we see Jorah defeat numerous fighters before revealing his identity to Daenerys. The best moments were saved for Queen Cersei; Lena Headey does a great job portraying one of the most devious and self-serving women in Westeros; first she is telling her son that she will do what she can for Margaery; then she is tormenting her in a way that could almost be considered friendly if we didn't know she didn't mean a word she said and Margaery knew it, finally her reaction to her reversal of fortunes was great; although I doubt many will sympathise with the character's plight. Overall this was one of the best episodes of the season.",

                    "content": "Last week had many critics as has this entire season, but I think episode 7 proved that this season is finally in full throttle. Most of the main cast was in the episode and we got possibly the coolest moment of the entire season.We began in the north for the better part of the first 30 minutes, and it was pretty slow paced. Jon Snow left for the wildlings and the wall began to crumble. We also lost the old Targaryen died and Sam has barely any friends left. Which put Gilly in a bad position as we nearly had yet another rape scene. I was kind of hoping Sam would end up killing those guys. Ghost saving them felt too easy. And then to go on and have him and Gilly hook up felt tonally off. It was a pretty awkward scene to watch. Elsewhere in the north, Stannis is ready to march onto Winterfell but Melisandre has other plans. They are really painting Stannis as a much better guy this season so I hope he doesn't somehow give up his daughter to Melisandre. In Winterfell, Sansa plots against Ramsay with Theon, which predictably so turns south. Sophie Turner really shined this week as both a strong and broken character. She's come a long way since her season 1 days. But it was really heartbreaking to watch Ramsay get away with all that he does. Brienne has had a long enough break, wouldn't we all love to see her kill him?Onto our favorite road trip comedy, Tyrion and Jorah. Their story picked up this week as they were sold into the fighting pits. It was nice to see Tyrion doing some as* kicking this week instead of the opposite way around. But by far the coolest scene of the season was seeing them meet up with Dany. Jorah brought his 'gift' to Dany, Tyrion. I don't see a good future for Jorah, but Tyrion's situation could wind up being a great turn for both the characters. They need each other. Back in Kings Landing, we have several, and I mean several, great scenes with the High Sparrow. We know Margaery and Loras are in jail and about to be on trial but I don't think we expected to see Cersei get the same treatment. She is easily one of the top 5 characters on the show so this becomes probably the top storyline of the future. The end of this season could turn out to have more WTF's than any of the past seasons.It's worth mentioning that Bronn had an entertaining scene with the sand snakes, although I didn't really see the point for it other than comedic relief. Can we assume that he's cured now? It just seemed too easy. Also, Olenna Tyrell had a great scene with the High Sparrow and Littlefinger. I love how one week it seems like he's on one side and then the next week it's the opposite. He's just a fascinating character and always a joy to watch. It was nice to see him help the Tyrell's out there too as that was his 'Gift'. Well, there you have it, probably my favorite and most shocking episode of the season so far. Here's to winter! +Sophie Turner+Snow takes charge +Sam steps up +My name is Tyrion Lannister +High Sparrow scenes +Cersei is going down +Littlefinger plans -Gilly scenes felt off -No point to the Bronn scene, is he safe? 9.6/10",

After the perverse pounding scene from last episode, Theon and Sansa are still trudging through their own ordeals. It's a bit disturbing, especially concerning Theon who is farther from redemption with each episode. Stannis, on the other hand, suffers losses even before the war begins. As Jon Snow's supposed reinforcement is still away, a desperate measure is presented in front of him.Much of the time spent in North is with Sam. He has proved to be resilient and while not in usual conventional fashion, he is heroic in his own right. It's nice to see an ordinary man amidst the warlords and scheming generals. King's Landing has no shortage of those as houses play with politic, faith and knowledge. Olenna Tyrell does everything in her power to free her grandchildren. She might find the power her house holds is dwindling as the faith grows in strength, dangerously so.In Dorne Jamie has little progress on convincing his love struck daughter/niece. He has had no luck with women or children, so this might take him a while. One of more intriguing moments happens with the favorite sell-sword Bronn who secretly has a talent to become a bard and his newly acquainted female warrior who has more weapons in her arsenal. The interaction between them is witty, seductive and entertaining in strangely lethal manner.The royalties have equally surprising encounters. Lena Headey as Cersei gives a bizarre yet compelling display of affection. Even with her usual cold demeanor, she is convincingly passionate when it comes to her children. It's personal for her because Margeary sees his son as chess piece while Cersei truly adores him unconditionally.The episode closes as Jorah makes his last gambit to gain the affection of women he lost. After investing so much, it's hard not to cheer for one of the most underdog characters of the series. It also presents one of the most awaited meetings of the series, which should present faster development for things to come.",

                    "content": "There's a really clever scene in the North which begins the seventh episode and it's something that we haven't seen in GOT for a while. Clever camera-work can often substitute for good acting or dialogue and in this case it gets the point across in a really ingenious way. We see broken Reek, arguing and sobbing and apologizing for all his sins with an equally broken Sansa, who begs him to take a candle up to the broken tower and light it to signal to her Northern allies. Reek trudges out through the snow into the courtyard, glancing up at the old tower...he rounds the spiral staircase, the music swells, waiting, hoping for something for Sansa to change, he opens the door...and...The soundtrack comes to a sudden halt and it's not the broken tower at all that he's been climbing. It's Ramsay Snow's quarters and in just a few shots we've been told of Reek's continued obedience/slavery without hardly a word. It's almost as good as the scene way back when Tyrion deals out three separate rumours to Pycelle, Varys and Littlefinger in order to weed out the spy. Great bit of subtle storytelling. Which is a shame because I don't really think that they needed to show the old serving lady being flayed. We know how ruthless Ramsay can be already and I think it would have been a better direction to have Reek be too scared to do it but keep it a secret. But anyway I don't know what Brienne is waiting for. It's not like Sansa's life is getting any better and it's going to take everything to get over the cold winter walls. On the wall we see Jon leaving for what seems like a doomed mission because bar Sam the entire Night's Watch disagrees with his intent of saving those wildlings, even if they would just pose a bigger problem come winter and white walkers. Sam has grown a lot from that first cowardly confession atop the wall to Jon in the first season, and his feeble attempts at sword play. He still doesn't really get much better at that despite slaying a white walker, although it is nice to see Ghost pop up again. Peter Vaughn finally bows out tonight after a long reign as the maester of the Night's Watch. What a touching and rather melancholy last moment he receives, as he dreams of a forgotten age of Westeros where the Targaryens were still in power and Aegon the fifth was still a babe in his arms. Gracefully done. And now his watch is ended. Is it a hint of Joffrey we see in Tommen as he spits angrily to his surprisingly calm mother on the fate of his newly wedded queen? Or just a young and naive king who cannot bear to be away from his first? The show has put these two great houses into very comprising situations despite their power and wealth and now they are basically on their knees, at the mercy of the gods and the Faith. Even Olenna Tyrell seems to beg for some sort of agreement to free his grandchildren. Seemingly the Lannister and Tyrell guards have vanished, along with the City Watch and even the Kingsguard have been rendered useless, and we haven't really been given much indication of how much power and influence over the common folk that the Faith has. So what is stopping anyone from marching a small army to their gates and taking back their prisoners?What's more troubling is Cersei's 'master plan' that finally derails at the end of this episode. Sure, you can put it down to her incompetence (which we have seen plenty of it), but even then her motivations seem weak. Rid of her first born son and father at the hands of her enemies and seeing a loss in power, her plan is to get Loras Tyrell arrested for homosexuality and Margaery for...perjury? What exactly does she think will occur, because I doubt that the crime is big enough for Cersei to return to power as Queen Regent. Which makes it more grating how confident and smug she seems in the jail. It is however a very satisfying and logical move for the Faith to arrest her for the incest brought upon them by the confession of Lancel. Even without the high flying rumours of her and Jaime they have a very solid case against her. It's finally come to bite her in the back and this time she is without ally in King's Landing. Finally in the East we've been fast forwarded quite a bit in the storyline. What is supposedly a long journey suddenly arrives at its climax with Jorah and Tyrion arriving in the lower fighting pits of Meereen. How great is the little mutter from the slave master to his fighters after seeing the queen and his hurried urgency to straighten them up? \"It's the f*cking queen...!\" We get to see a great bit of the brute force and efficiency that Jorah deals out with his Westori training as a knight but the real delight is finally seeing the meeting of the dragon and the lion. This is certainly the match-up we've been waiting for; no two bigger main characters have met before like this, after starting so far away at the beginning of the series. With a real adviser at her side, how will this change things in Meereen? It's hopeful better advice than the very heavy handed metaphor that Daario gives.",

                    "content": "So Game of Thrones' fifth season has finally given us its first truly perfect episode, almost three quarters of the way into this year's run. It's been very easy to label this season as the show's weakest year; after all, it did come off the back of what is arguably one of the most eventful seasons of any TV show, period. But the show's renewed emphasis on weighty thematic ideas and intricate character work has let us to this, and now season five has but three episodes left to take us back to the big, explosive Westeros we came to love in the first few seasons. The Gift is far and away the best episode of this season yet, in fact I think I'd have to go further back to season four's stellar The Laws of Gods and Men to find the last episode that topped this one. It may not represent Game of Thrones at its most shockingly dramatic, but The Gift is a surprisingly emotional episode, reinforced by concrete character development, some huge plot leaps and the best writing we've had all year. Welcome back, Westeros.When I label this episode an \"emotional\" one, I don't mean it in the terms of making the viewer cry or eliciting an actual emotional response in the audience. Rather, The Gift felt content in allowing characters to put their own loved ones first, creating an episode in which even Cersei was almost likable. Even those who hate Cersei and everything she stands for would struggle to not feel something for her as she talks with Tommon about family values and what that means to her; if Cersei has one overall redeeming quality, it is that she loves her children more than anything in her world. Sam and Gilly were also treated to an emotional sequence this week, following the upsetting but unsurprising death of Maester Aemon. Sam and Gilly have been two of my favourite characters in this show for a long time now, so it was great to seem them given some truly serious stuff to play with, as both of them handled it with ease. Also shocking was Melisandre's (still Game of Thrones's most captivating on screen presence) request that Stannis sacrifice his own daughter in order to aid his advancement to Winterfell. Stannis shot this idea down instantly, further emphasising this episode's focus on family.This episode really comes into form in it's final fifteen minutes, though, in which two of the show's most beloved characters finally come into contact for the first time, and it was seamless. Jorah's unveiling of himself in front of Daenerys was a superbly tense moment, leaving the audience unsure as to which way Dany would fall. She soon answers that question with a resounding \"Get him out of my sight\", before Tyrion makes his presence known in what I would happily label the season's most exciting sequence yet. Any other episode and this would take the final scene, but The Gift had more to tell. Last week we watched as both Loras and Margaery Tyrell were arrested by the Faith Militant for lying under oath, but I don't think anyone expected the following episode to result in Cersei herself succumbing to the same fate. Lancel's reveal was handled expertly, and Jonathon Pryce delivered arguably the best monologue of the season as the High Sparrow built to Cersei's arrest. The entire final act of episode seven was simply masterful stuff.It may have taken a little longer to reach perfection than the show's other seasons, but this year's Game of Thrones is a very different show, as outlined in my review for episode one seven weeks back. Westeros is a different world to what it once was, and this is reflected in the show itself. Whilst it has been easy, and justifiable, to label this season disappointing, should the following three episodes sustain the narrative momentum we saw here, then season five could be able to claw its way back. I barely had time here to discuss Theon's betrayal of Sansa, or the fact that a Sand Snake was given solid screen time and actually performed well; there was just so much to talk about suddenly. The first six episodes were set up, and that phase did last far too long for a ten episode season (60% setup is difficult to justify), but if these upcoming episodes return to Game of Thrones' explosive roots, they could ultimately hit harder than ever because of this. If the show takes a step down again next week, then The Gift may end up feeling like a misplaced lightning fast episode dropped into a slow, set-up season. Either way, it's the best thing this show has done all year.",

                    "content": "I hate to say it, but more happened in this episode than in the last three combined. This is why I think David Benioff and D. B. Weiss are the best writers, because they understand how the show needs to progress, and how to set out the perfect scenes. Bryan Cogman is good, but there's a heavy concentration on major revelations, rather than fleshing them out a bit more, and ultimately the scenes seem unfinished and imperfect. Dave Hill's new to the game, so we can't blame him, but his episode certainly did have some significant moments.Anyhow, whilst the episode itself may seem quite quiet, as in there's nothing predominantly game- changing, Benioff and Weiss counter that with some deeply satisfying plot twists and dialogue that will knock your woolly socks off. Not to mention that a number of characters get some heavy development, including Samwell, Stannis, Olenna, Bronn, and of course our dearest Cersei. Stakes are high in the world of Game of Thrones, and when they're high, the writers get a chance to open things out a little. It could've been a mess, considering the fact that the writers had to fit 22 starring cast members into just under an hour of television - and to do it so deftly - is notorious of these show runners.In the North, people are scattering, with Jon heading north-east to Hardhome and to hopefully start a new relationship with the help of Tormund Giantsbane. Samwell get some much-needed character development, particularly in showing his outright loyalty to Gilly. She rewards him kindly, and there's a real intimate relationship brewing. Also, we get to see glimpse of Ghost again. Stannis is also making a stand, this time to Melisandre, who has controversially stated that Shireen may be used in a sacrifice to Rhllor to help the King's cause, something that I doubt he would ever let happen. Equally, Ramsay is still holding his ground at Winterfell, but Sansa still has some fire within her yet - she's picked up a weapon after all. The shot of Brienne watching from afar is superbly envisioned - like a guardian angel, watching and waiting for the right moment. If only Theon had done the right thing.In King's Landing, the Tyrell family gains a little back. A word joust between Olenna and the High Sparrow, followed by another with Baelish, leads to Cersei's imprisonment. It's great to see the true nature of the High Sparrow and how Lady Olenna realises that the Faith is more than just a group of people - they actually believe in justice. And to see Cersei's demise was a truly satisfying moment. Jonathan Pryce couldn't have played it better.In Dorne, we learn two things. Myrcella may be a lost cause unless Jaime can somehow persuade her otherwise, and the Sand Snakes really should not be messed with. We see a side of Bronn that we haven't seen before, scared and desperate. After all, he wanted a quiet death, and the poison in Tyene's dagger was far from what he wanted. More is needed though before the end of this season - the Dorne storyline still feels incomplete.Finally, in Meereen, the moment has happened that we've been expecting for a long while - Tyrion's meeting with Daenerys. Ser Jorah's love for seeing her is priceless, because we can't see how much he's wanted to see her. His battle with his fellow warriors is short-lived but enough for us to anticipate what happens next. Daenerys' expression explains it all. But if next week's trailer is anything to go by, Ser Jorah may still be struggling to find a place in Khaleesi's court.From start to finish, this a stunning hour of television, giving this season a surge forward into the final three episodes, where I can see a lot of things happening. Game of Thrones continues to be one of my very favourite TV series, mainly because it is able to progress through a world- building structure in quite a serious fashion and continues to display realistic characters going through their realistic emotions. Almost flawless this week.9.5/10",

This episode also brought out some of the best acting i have seen on this show so far, from Cerci and Tommens emotional scene, to Sam, Gilly and the High Sparrow. Although for me Sansa delivered the best scene I have seen from her on the show. After being raped and tormented by Ramsey see really made me feel for her with her emotional plea for help to Theon/Reek. For me this was clearly the best episode of the season (so far at least) and I expect plots to develop pretty rapidly from this point onwards, especially for Jon considering the title of next weeks episode. 10/10.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Although it seems to not be a popular opinion, actually liked Season 5 better than most fans. It was not perfect by any stretch, the Sand Snakes being a notable flaw and were the main drawback to the polarising but to me better than given credit for \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\". There was also a lot to admire and love and personally liked to loved the previous episodes despite things taking a while to settle. While \"The Gift\" was the season's first truly outstanding episode, it is with \"Hardhome\" that sees 'Game of Thrones' in all its glory. \"Hardhome\" is not just the magnum opus of Season 5 even with two episodes left to go (the previous season magnum opuses being Season 1 with \"Baelor\", Season 2 with \"Blackwater\", Season 3 with \"The Rains of Castamere\" and Season 4 with \"The Laws of Gods of Men\" with a good case being made too for \"The Children\"), but also one of the best episodes of the entire show.Plotlines and character development are advanced the most they were all season. There is a perfect balance of intricate character moments and drama, especially with Arya, the character of Karsi and showing signs of hope in increasingly dire straits. Similarly, there is a powerful mix of heart-wrenching poignancy, nail-biting intensity, shocking revelations and some of the show's most spectacular action that has emotional impact (exciting, terrifying and moving) and is more than just spectacle. The characters are all interesting and layered, and \"Hardhome\" boasts the sharpest script of Season 5, and one of the sharpest of the whole show, and the tightest pacing of all the fifth season episodes, anyone frustrated with the slow pace of the previous episodes (personally am not one of them) will be relieved.'Game of Thrones' always delivers on the acting. The casting is spot on and the performances are superb across the board, particularly from Peter Dinklage, Emilia Clarke, Maisie Williams and Birgitte Hjort Sorensen.Visually, \"Hardhome\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Hardhome\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.In conclusion, a fantastic episode that hits home hard. Anyone disappointed with the previous episodes, a lot were and again not one of them, will be thrilled with this. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

You get half an hour of a normal episode to begin with, which is of the same high standard as previous instalments, but then things let rip with a north-of-the-wall set-piece in which Jon, Tormund and their allies come into contact with the Night King and his army for the first time properly in the show's history. It's an amazing, astonishing set-piece of undead mayhem, shot like a horror film and far more terrifying than anything THE WALKING DEAD managed in its entire history. The writing and production values are so good here that the show manages to effortlessly introduce three new fine characters and has no compunction about bumping two of them off before the ending. As for that final scene...wow!",

We get to see Tyrion engage with Dany and Jorah go rogue. Tyrion saved his life, but undermined his spirit. Cersei is in her cell, being tormented by the High Sparrow legion. You have to say she has more gumption that Scarlett O'Hara ever did. We finally get to where Theon admits to Sansa that the boys he killed were farmers, not her brothers (as if that weren't bad enough). But Theon/Reek still is stuck in his own fears and his fears for Sansa. Arya continues her quest to get revenge by keeping on in that monastic setting, being tested. These guys aren't necessarily good guys. The conclusion, however, is the star as John tries to ally himself with his formerly sworn enemies. The white walkers are in their element, and there are as many as snowflakes in a blizzard. For those complaining about the slowness of the fifth season should know better.",

The second good point - the dialogue between Dannarys and Tyron. And , sure, Arya as oyster merchand, status who represents a more significant role than tool of God with many faces. The presence of Jon in Hardhome is the drawing of his future political status. More than protector of the Wall, he has the duty to be the maker of reconcilliation. Not easy . But his mission is fundamental.",

In Winterfell, Theon discloses to Sansa that Ramsay has mutilated him and also that he has not killed her two brothers Bran and Rickon. Ramsey tries to convince his father to attack Stannis. Jon Snow and Tormund meet the Wildlings in their village and try to convince them to move to Castle Black, but only 5,000 of them accept the offer and embark in the ships. Out of the blue, they are attacked by the wights and White Walkers. \"Hardhome\" is probably the best episode of \"Game of Thrones\" so far with an unforgettable and exciting battle. All the segments are important and interesting but the fight between the Wildlings and the Night's Watch against the wights and the White Walkers is the best sequence ever. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Hardhome",

Elsewhere in Essos Tyrion persuades Daenerys to keep him as adviser but Jorah Mormont is once again exiled from the city. Back in Westeros Cersei is still in the dungeons; she is told that a confession will get her out of a trial she is almost certain to be convicted in but refuses. In Winterfell Sansa confronts Theon and learns that he did not in fact kill her two younger brothers. North of the wall, where most of this episode's action takes place, Jon and Tormund Giantsbane reach the Wildling town of Hardhome where they try to persuade to people to join forces and fight the White Walkers in exchange for land south of the wall. Some agree and start boarding boats; before they can all leave the town comes under attack from a large force of White Walkers.This episodes obvious highlight was what happened at Hardhome. Things start in an exciting manner when Tormund is confronted by the Lord of Bones and kills him. That is nothing compared to the excitement of the battle scenes. This wasn't just a bit of a scrap where we only see a handful of people fighting at a time; instead we have large numbers of combatants battling it out in a scene that wouldn't have felt out of place in a large budget movie. The walkers look impressive; especially their leaders who are clearly not just mindless zombies. The goings on in Essos, King's Landing and Winterfell were interesting too; it was fun to see Arya acting in a more girly manner even if she was playing a role. The scene between Tyrion and Daenerys was impressive; it was interesting to have a scene featuring a Lannister and a Targaryen at last. After all of Sansa's suffering it was good to see her have a beacon of hope as she learns that her younger brothers are alive. Overall I'd say this was the best episode of the fifth season and up amongst the best overall.",

                    "content": "Season 5 to most fans has been the weakest season, that is until last week and then tonight's episode. Wow, back to back phenomenal episodes that finally paid off some of the things that has been teased for quite some time. Coming off of last week's legendary moment with Daenerys and Tyrion meeting for the first time, I figured this week would start fast but then slow down and set up a lot more for the last two episodes of the season. Instead we got a high octane thrill ride and easily the best episode of the season.The scenes with Dany and Tyrion were great this week. It's just really cool to watch these two characters interact with each other after so long. They both are incredibly stubborn with plenty of wit so the dynamic between them should keep us entertained for awhile. I was glad to see Dany ultimately decide on letting Tyrion advise her after asking all the questions we knew she would ask about him. But I was sad to see Jorah go. We know he will be fighting in the pits but will he die there or from the stone disease? It seems unlikely that Dany will ever let him back into her circle at this point. Even so, we know his death is inevitable at some point, but I just hope he goes out honorably. We then cut to Kings Landing where Cersei is spending her time rotting away in a cell. I never thought I would see Cersei lick water off the ground. It's interesting that while Tyrion was locked up last season, Jaime visited him often. But yet when Cersei is in jail, the only person that came to visit her was that scientist who's working on the mountain. Not even her own son and the king himself has came to see her. I'm not sure how this story ends up, but I hope they conclude it by the end of the season. I don't want to have to wait a full year for all 3 trials.We got a brief Sansa scene in the north where she finds out that her brothers are still alive. I was glad to see him tell Sansa and it was a glimpse of Theon left in Reek and a hope that he will redeem himself at some point. I would like to see him help Sansa escape somehow but that ship has seemed to have sailed. And Brienne can get her revenge on Stannis, but I would assume the latter stays alive this season. Back at Castle Black, Sam had a quick scene in which I thought was setting up the last half of the episode by saying \"Jon always comes back\". I was worried for Snow. And did anybody have any idea that it would be this much of a white walker episode? Jon had a great moment rallying the wildlings only to have a huge battle and lose half the wildlings. What an epic battle it was. But Jon Snow and his valyrian steel prevailed, at least for now. I think the white walkers are a bigger threat than people are giving them credit for. Then again, I would assume the dragons could do one swoop in, breathe fire, and kill them all within minutes. But the defining scene was the silent stare down between the head white walker and Jon Snow. Maybe that's a foreshadow of next season or the season after when they next meet. So with only a few episodes left, Game of Thrones is picking up a bit. Plus, next week is the infamous 9th episode of the season, oh boy.+Tyrion & Dany dynamic +Sansa demanding Theon +Valyrian steel +Cersei dropping real low +Spokes on a wheel +Stare down 10/10",

Sure, costumer, set design, acting is at their best, but something was missing. Episode 8 gave us FINALLY that missing piece. WOW was the first word that came to my mind after witnessing this piece of art. Won't going to spoil anything, but this is hands down the best episode of season 5, and one of the very best of the entire show - it is THAT good. There were many great written exchanges in this episode, very strong acting us usual, and what an outcome. Sure, it's not the outcome yet, but what a spectacular, superbly directed, shoot sequence at the end. Kudos to all involved, terrific sequence, probably to big to wittiness it on a small screen - what other shows do something like that?Overall, Episode 7 gets 8/10, and Episode 8 pure 10/10. \"I think we are fxxxed\" - that is probably was the first thought that came to John Snow's mind at the very end of this sequence.",

                    "content": "This episode may very well be the best of the season, capturing the major characters as they are at most private moment or facing grave predicament. Arya has begun her training, which is actually an exercise in medieval espionage. The girl dons new name and outfits, then the girl pretends. The relationship with her enigmatic mentor is highly unconventional, yet Arya seems content. This is strangely one of her happier times.Meanwhile the matriarchs of the kingdoms have much different fates. Cersei doesn't face her incarceration well, she must lower herself to the man he gave power to. While the prospect of humility sickens her, the need for survival might be enough to overcome that. Daenerys has much better luck as she meets with the wise Tyrion. The two have a very good chemistry, this encounter is long overdue, and it turns out to be a pleasant one. The same cannot be said for Jorah who still longs for the every so distant affection.The best comes at the second half as Jon Snow ventures deep into hostile territory. Icy village of the Wildlings is nothing short of breathtaking. Mix of winter landscape and isolated settlement make for an amazingly cool visual. Negotiation goes as expected, stern opposition from most, a touch of violence and reasonable few willing to hear his plea for mutual survival. It all changes when the White Walker nation attacks.Tyrion and Daenerys are not the only ones having fateful meeting. The elusive White Walkers make their presences known as they storm Jon Snow and the Wildlings like a plague. With excellent choreography and special effects, the skirmish has the production value any feature length movie would envy. Each scene is as fascinating and engaging than the last, culminating in intense physical and tearful emotional struggle.This is Game of Thrones as its peak, and quite possibly the best presentation any TV show could hope to offer.",

                    "content": "We open to the immediate aftermath of the Lion and the Dragon meeting in her throne room. Tyrion has always been known for dealing the hard truth and he does it here with great effect. It's the sort of logical cold fact which trumps the emotional insecurities and desires of Jorah; whatever he may plead, his devotion is built on a base of lies and betrayal. With one blow Tyrion becomes much more than a dwarf in rags to Dany while Jorah is once again exiled. But he will not resign himself to the ruins of Valyria and the Stone Men. Jorah the Andal's story is not yet over. Daznak's Pit awaits. After no sign of Arya last week we see a sudden jump in her storyline. She is ready to become someone else, something else. And how lively are the markets of Braavos! At last we get to step through the bustle and hubbub of the harbour- side as the score jumps up and down and suggests a living breathing world instead of a filming set. It's brilliantly inter-cut with the voice-over and the recitation of Arya and her master as she ascends to the new role of the oyster seller. The music turns ominous as she finally is granted her first mission of assassination. There's a vast array of fine acting performances throughout this episode, even in the smaller story lines. In a dank dungeon a withered and beaten Cersei cries for any assistance at all. It's often forgotten but Lena Headey becomes Cersei so effortlessly through all the scorn and contempt that is visible in her facial expressions. Her reign is at it's end, a different women from the prideful queen. In Winterfell, a tense confrontation between a Sansa that vocalises her frustrations and fears more-so than the entire season and a broken Reek who manages to let slip one confession. A silhouette of two beaten and defeated characters, one with the facade of strength, standing tall and visibly emotional after hearing a tiny glimpse of hope, the first in months. The other, still frightened and brainwashed. How easy it is to forget the acting. But the real objective is Hardhome. Hardhome, the title of the episode. The vast and expansive frozen land on which the wildlings have made camp. It's a very impressive setting as the boats row in, matching the rhythm of the slow tense beats of the bass drum. It's so satisfying to hear the words that come out of Jon and Tormund's mouths. The undeniable grains of truth are that the White Walkers are coming and only behind the Wall will there be safety. Jon's goodwill and Tormund's rationality shine through with each breath. Yet the world of Westeros is not one of logic and rationality. Thousands of years of separation and hostility exist in the blood of the wildlings and not all of them can shake hands with a crow. There are bigger dangers out there however. First the howls of dogs, always a sure sign of bad things to come. Then an eyeball poking out of a gap, wondering... It's great how they didn't resort to a jump- scare here and it makes the reveal all the more effective. A few cries, screams, the hint of bodies moving... It's without a doubt the best large scale battle of the entire series so far. Of course the Battle at the Wall was a spectacle, but here there is the first real sense of urgency, fear and panic in the air. The visual effects for each of the wights are at once more cost effective than the battle near the cave that Bran and co. fought through last season. The shaky cam is perhaps a bit excessive and at some moments the zoom is too close to really tell what is going on, but it's exactly the sort of chaos and frenzy that the scene needs. There's a significant longer take in between the frenetic editing, where Jon sprints through the battlefield, hacks a few wights and makes his way over to the hut with the dragon-glass only for a giant to rip through the roof with a bellow, skeletons hanging onto his back. He rips them off and stamps them dead with his foot with such ferocity and the camera angle is just perfect that it really showcases his might and size along with the excellent sound design of his roars and his massive foot hitting the ground.That's perhaps not even the most menacing part of the episode. The four horsemen emerge from the mists with only brief outlines visible but even that is enough to tell us what we are dealing with. We get a much closer look as Jon attempts to hold one off while searching for the vital dragon-glass. The costuming and makeup are icy cold and completely frightening. You feel as if they are completely alien and possess a deadly danger beyond what Westeros have ever seen. All without speaking a single word. There's the icy figures of dead children unborn as the wildling chieftainess (Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen making her debut and possible exit) struggles to hod back over the stuttering score which is reminiscent of a horror movie's soundtrack. But here it works because this is unlike anything they have ever witnessed. A medieval setting with a few hints of fiery dragons and dark magic, and north, far far north, the biggest threat the continent awaits. Similarly to the ending of the Red Wedding, the credits are soft. The icy water laps up against the shore where dead comrades, sons, daughters, fathers, mothers all breath new life. What an utterly exhilarating and fantastic episode of Game of Thrones that was. I only hope it will be topped by the 9th or the finale as tradition states. 10/10",

This episode though has to be one of the best I've seen on TV. It's up there for the final episode of Spartacus for incredibly memorable scenes.The battle of Hardhome was so well put together. The FX, the fighting, the music, the sense of panic were all next level. The final scene played out in absolute silence after the noisy frenzy of the previous 20 minutes was just fantastic.The sense of dread as the Night King just stared at Jon as he and his rag tag bag of survivors silently slipped away and the camera pulled back to reveal the scale of the white walkers army was just incredible.Here we are watching all about the silly politics of who will be King yet there is a serious, serious threat at the door which only Jon and his crew are fully aware of.A genuine class act.",

                    "content": "Wow this episode caught me off guard, usually in every Game of Thrones season, episode 9 is always the one where the most thrilling action and shocking events take place, which is why this episode is as great as it is.This season has been great, not the best season out of Game of Thrones, but no fan of the show can deny it, this is by far the best episode on the show, if not one of the best episode ever to be aired on screen. The episode begins with the long awaited meeting with the Mother of Dragons, and the drunken favourite dwarf, and it does not let down. Since this has yet to happen in the novels, the writers do a fantastic job and creating the back and forth between these two loved characters. And Emilia Clarke does some of her best acting in this episode.In Braavos not too much happens this episode, but we do get to see a small hint of the work Arya will undertake in her later years as an assassin, as she begins to stalk an old name from her list.In Kings landing, Cersei is still imprisoned by the Faith, and is being tortured by some of their followers, and this scene was brilliant. The performance Lena Headey gives this episode is ground breaking, as is most this season. We then move to the North with some thrilling dialogue between two of the most hated villains currently in TV, as they plan on attacking Stannis' army, and we finally get to see Theon (Reek) confess to Sansa that he did not in fact, murder her brothers back in season 2. This was some of the best moments in the entire series, not just because that Theon finally admitted it, but we finally got to see some form of hope again, that a Stark may be reunited with a family member, as so many of them have been killed. At the Wall, nothing really happens, other than Sam comforting Olly about Jon Snow, also quoting \"Jon always comes back.\" A sort of hint to book readers there.Now we get to the big moment, the part of the show that blew everyone away, the part that could rival some of the best action scenes in cinema. First of all the production here was fantastic, not once did the effects look fake, there was next to no evidence that they used green screen, and it really helps with the eerie feel of Hardhome. From the moment Jon Snow, Tormund and the Nights Watch step foot on the shores of Hardhome, you get an instant feel that something is about to go down, but never did you get the impression that they would be swarmed by an army of skinless zombies. The tension built in this episode is beyond what anyone could expect, and an amazing soundtrack to help you along the way. Seeing Jon Snow fight along side the Wildlings was outstanding to watch. The well choreographed fight scenes were perfect for this episode, and the director does a brilliant job and immersing you into the fight. Not only did we get to see a giant smack zombies with a log (how cool was that?), but we finally got to see a good look at the shows main villain. The effects on the Nights King was great, they blended make up and visual effects very well to make a convincing looking bad guy. When the episode ends we get a small breather, and the show runners give us a small hint at the war and slaughter that will happen when the White Walkers cross over the wall, and I can't wait. Hopefully Daenerys Targaryen flies in on the back of a Dragon, now that would be epic.10/10 best episode of the series.",

The Wights were jumping off a mountain, but a giant can somehow crush them? Why are the Wights biting at people? Why didn't the Wildlings set fire to their perimeter fence, I mean seriously, fire burns, you know. If those dead Wights lose a hand that hand comes alive, not in Hardhome however. We needed to see a zombie pyramid scale the fence, thats why. No towers next to the gate, instead we had a game of peek-a-boo. The giant where was he on the wall? He would have made a much better zombie. How tall was that giant? He could have walked to the wall, never mind those ships, but how did he get inside the hut? Those Whitewalkers, ugh, in their armor, yawn. The little children cannibal Wights were from Craster keep, so that is where they went? There will be many children clearly amused by a budget spent on surplus",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Dance of Dragons\" may not quite be on the same level as Season 5's magnum opus \"Hardhome\", also one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes overall. That is a very tall order, because that episode was so special and actually saw even those who found the previous Season 5 episodes slow going (personally feel that although not on the same level as the previous four seasons, and a flawed one, that all Season 5's episodes ranged from good to outstanding, not a popular opinion probably) impressed. Although the polarisation of the fan reaction is understandable, count me in as somebody who loved \"The Dance of Dragons\" overall. Not without faults, no didn't think it was a perfect or 10/10 episode. The special effects have been much more polished before and the Dorne storyline (a consistent criticism of Season 5 among critics and fans) is not as interesting or as involving as the rest of the episode, also a bit silly.However, \"The Dance of Dragons\" is notable especially for two scenes. One is the whole climax in Meereen, especially in Daznak's Pit, which was spectacular, exciting and thrillingly intense with Daenerys' role being iconic for her and of the show visually and dramatically. The other is the episode's most controversial scene with Stannis and Shireen, one of the most tragic and disturbing of the whole of 'Game of Thrones' and the most hard-hitting the show has been since the Red Wedding. It shocked me and it brought me to tears.Am going to defend this scene now considering how much it's been criticised and talked about. Can understand the problems others had with this scene, with them showing dislike for Stannis turning from morally complex to a monster by one act which has been described as out of character and a character distortion. For me, that is true for book Stannis but not show Stannis, remember this is a character who would stop at nothing to get what he wants and he had shown numerous murderous traits actually since Season 2 and for trivial reasons, also he was much less wilful initially here than he was with those showing some moral complexity still. Getting back on track, once again cannot fault the acting, with strong performances from Emilia Clarke, Kit Harington, Carice Van Houten and particularly Stephen Dillane in some of his best acting as Stannis to date.Plot lines and character development continue to advance, there is a perfect balance of intricate character moments and drama and there is a powerful mix of heart-wrenching poignancy, nail-biting intensity and shocking revelations.Visually, \"The Dance of Dragons\" looks amazing (apart from the effects), as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Dance of Dragons\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Writing continues to be layered and thoughtful and the storytelling riveting.In conclusion, excellent if divisive episode. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Until this point we get a pretty decent episode in which an overly drawn-out sub-plot featuring Arya's character is made up for by a shocking twist in the Stannis storyline, a gut-punch as powerful as THAT famous episode of THE WALKING DEAD in which Negan first showed up. It's hardly pleasant to sit through, but it does make sense in the scheme of things. In any case, the final arena set-piece is one of the best in the show's entire series, in which a dragon finally, properly lets rip for the first time and the lavish, gruesome action is much like a large scale Red Wedding. Tremendous stuff, and the odd second of dodgy CGI doesn't lessen the fun at all. Plus, Ser Jorah...what more can I say?",

The series has pushed the envelope time after time after time. There's incest, sexual excess, nudity, graphic violence, on and on. The Game of Thrones is about power and the effects of power. When the little girl gets burned, many think the series has gone to far. It doesn't matter that numerous children have died in other episodes. What about the farm children that are the focus of Theon? This is a fiction and it's often about the worst of humanity. It's about every level of ambition possible. It is about people that see life as nothing, unless it's their own, and even then it's not valued. There are great scenes here. The final battle is quite amazing. Let's look at this series for what it is and stop imposing our own belief system on it. If you have very conservative views on this, it shouldn't be your cup of tea. I know that \"it is what it is\" is a clich\u00e9 these days, but nothing is more apt. Also, quit comparing everything in the books to the film. Everyone knows that every adaptation that has been done is different from the final result. Hail \"King of Thrones\" for being honest and incredibly entertaining. I can't wait for the finale of Season 5.",

Doran Martell has an amicable conversation with Jamie telling that he does not want war, and they agree arrangements for Myrcella and Prince Trystane in King's Landing. Ellaria is skeptic about their agreement. Arya is selling oysters in an assignment of Jaqen H'ghar and the stumbles with Meryn Trant. She decides to follow him in a brothel instead of finishing her task. Stannis takes the ultimate cruel decision to win the war. Daenerys and her husband open the fighting pit and they are surprised by the Sons of Harpy. However, she is saved by Jorah and Daario and rescued by one of her sons.\"The Dance of Dragons\" is another spectacular full of action episode of \"Game of Thrones. Jon Snow has increased the number o enemies in Castle Black giving refugee to the Wildlings. The unpredictable alliance between Doran and Jamie and the reaction of Allaria seems to indicate that he will be betrayed by her. The segment with Arya is still annoying. Daenery's revenge against the Sons of Harpy will be certainly cruel. But the heartbreaking moment is the attitude of Stannis toward his daughter. Fortunately I have not read the book; otherwise I would possibly hate the \"artistic freedom\" of HBO, transforming the beloved father Stannis Baratheon into a monster. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"The Dance of the Dragons\"",

                    "content": "As this episode opens Stannis's camp is attacked by a small force lead by Ramsey Bolton; important stocks and vital horses are destroyed and the attackers departed before anybody knows what is happening. This leads Stannis to order Davos Seaworth back to Castle Black to get further supplies; with him away Stannis does what Melisandre has demanded and makes a shocking sacrifice. Further north Jon and the Wildlings get to Castle Black and are relieved when the gate is opened. At the other end of Westeros Jaime Lannister meets Doran Martell and negotiates to take Myrcella back to King's Landing.Across the Narrow Sea in Essos Arya sets off to assassinate the 'thin man'; as she nears him she is distracted by the arrival of a boat carrying Mace Tyrell and more importantly Meryn Trant. She neglects her mission and follows Trant to a local brothel; she doesn't act against him but learns that he will be back the next day. In Meereen it is time for the Games where combatants fight to the death in the fighting pits. One of those fighting is Jorah Mormont who is determined to show his loyalty to Daenerys. As the fight ends The Sons of the Harpy attack spectators and move to kill Daenerys; she and a small group are surrounded in the middle of the pit when salvation comes in the form of one of her dragons.So far each 'episode nine' has either featured the surprising death of major characters or a battle that takes up the entire episode; this episode doesn't fit that pattern but it is still one of the most gripping as it frequently looks as though major characters are in real danger. This isn't to say that no recurring characters die; the death of Shireen Baratheon was one of the most surprising and disturbing deaths to date even though she was a relatively minor character. Arya's scenes were also fairly tense even though it never felt as though she would come to real harm. The highlight of the episode was of course the action in Meereen; this was exciting. This is especially true once the Sons of the Harpy attack\u0085 even though I suspect many viewers will have expected a dragon to come to Daenerys's rescue it is still great when it appears. Overall a gripping episode that left me looking forward to the series finale.",

                    "content": "Well it's the 9th episode of Game of Thrones. That usually means either a shocking event with tons of consequences or some out of nowhere death. Where this episode definitely had one of the best scenes of the season in the final Harpy battle, I don't think it lived up to the expectations of a typical 9th episode of a season. That's not to say there weren't some great moments, but if I'm basing this off of how high my expectations were, then it was a bit of a letdown.We began the episode with the Night's Watch and the wildlings making their way back to the wall and inside Castle Black. I was glad to see Alliser Thorne make the right move and open the gates instead of the clich\u00e9d back-stab that we may expect from his character. But what he said to Jon Snow is probably right, bringing all these wildlings to Castle Black may not be the smartest decision, especially with food supply significantly decreasing. Speaking of food supply, Stannis and his army took a hit as Ramsay's men burned a good chunk of their food. That sent Davos back to the castle to hopefully re-supply. With him leaving, he had to have one last scene with Shireen. Even though her death seemed inevitable with Melisandre's lust for another shadow baby, it was still devastating to see her be burned alive. They were definitely playing Stannis as a more lighthearted character this season so that when the time came, we would sympathize with him. I'm not sure he got my sympathy, but I still think Stannis may be the best option we have for the Iron Throne.We then visited Dorne where Bronn was granted his freedom and Jaime agreed to let his niece (*daughter*) marry the Martell Kid if she came back to King's Landing. It seems as though this story is over for the season and besides a few very funny Bronn moments, I think it turned out to be a weak part of the episodes. Another storyline that had potential and has struggled this season has been Arya's. She is still working towards becoming 'no one' and the episode didn't do anything to really further that story. There was plenty of false anticipation as she came across Meryn Trant from way back when. Perhaps this will pay off next week but for now, those scenes just felt unnecessary.We finally reached the 'WTF' episode 9 part when we came to the fighting pits in Meereen. I think Daenerys' character picked up momentum when Tyrion came into play but this week added another new dimension. The Sons of the Harpy are back and nearly ruined everything. It was cool to see Jorah fight in the pits for her, but in no way would I have been shocked to see him die. So seeing the Harpy show up was definitely a pleasant surprise. But I'm also not sure I felt the danger I should have for Dany considering I figured Drogon would show up. But it was still pretty awesome seeing their interaction together. Plus, Tyrion's reaction to Drogon was priceless. Being that the episode is called Dance of Dragons we needed to see at least one of them and it's about time Dany rides Drogon. So in all, I expected bigger things from this episode, but I wouldn't say it's a bad episode. It was just a letdown. But really if it wasn't a 9th episode of a season, I probably would have liked it a lot more. Here's hoping we get a bada** episode 10 with a few trials.+Frickin Dragons +Jorah proves himself +Bronn is free +Gates at the wall open without question -Started slow with some potentially unnecessary plot lines -Why is Meryn Trant a focus? 7.8/10",

In what may be the most vicious sacrifice in the show, and a strange contrast to Stannis' previously shown nature, he decides to trade his daughter for the promise of victory.There have been many deaths in the show, most are quick yet excruciating, but not Shireen's. Hers is through and through heart-wrenching. Her scream for parent's rescue fuels the agony even more.On the warmer side of the world, Jaime and Bronn unexpectedly get a more reasonable result on their political visit. Using actual politic maneuvering as well as a bit of luck, they manage to keep peace and their lives intact. There's lots of peculiar coalition between the two houses. It may just turn out well, after all there's bound to be one wedding where no one dies.Arya continues to perform her espionage duty as undercover merchant. Fate gives her a different path when she sees a familiar face, she follows this path to a brothel, of all places. If one unfortunate fate for a little girl isn't enough, there's an overwhelming hint of her exposed to a man's unusual appetite. This is a very uneasy development, really hoping she makes it through one more episode, with every bit of her unbroken.For the large skirmish on the snow before, this episode concludes with high octane battle on Daenerys' side. In a very entertaining gladiatorial game of death which then escalates into full blown riot, every character is involved in the intense survival. Honestly, the next scene could be the last of any character, the tension is genuine.It culminates in a mix of excellent choreography and visual effect. The show soars with sheer production value and its larger than life personalities.",

Some liked it for it's strong character development while others hated it for betraying Stannis' character after the past few seasons. Anyway, everything else is so compelling.The characters are still believable, the story/script is well-written this time around, the action is great especially the end of the movie where Daenerys flies on her dragon which takes your breath away and the music score from Ramin Djawadi suited really well. The pacing is great and doesn't drag, the directing is great, the scenery/set/costumes are still gorgeous to look at, and the performances are still great. So, overall, another classic episode that is emotional and compelling. :)",

                    "content": "Changes in the books have so far often been necessary, and usually made sense in the context of the series, even if it was for reasons that didn't have to do entirely with storytelling. Even incomprehensible cuts like lady Stoneheart could be tolerated. But in The Dance of Dragons Benioff and Weiss have not just gone too far, but have done so in such careless manner that it's hard to decide whether to be angry at them or mock them.I'll not focus too much on the utter betrayal of the character of Stannis. Let's start at the beginning of the episode, where Ramsay Snow takes the role of Vlad Tepes and does the show's version of the Night Attack. Convincing no one of how exactly he did this (generic excuse didn't really do the job), he sets the stage for a sacrifice that epitomises the writer's understanding of a twist: X says one thing, then does the opposite. Now, if you've read the book you know the potential for Shireen's sacrifice is there - except she's not with Stannis. And there are a trillion other potential targets for Melisandre first. Like Aemon, whom Jon sent away for that reason exactly. Or Mance Rayder, who...wait a minute, didn't they just burn him in the series too? And doesn't he have (according to Melisandre anyway) royal blood? Why, he does! But no one thought about that, because it would ruin our great idea (\"GRRM kills likable characters, if we do the same, we'll be just as good\").The most obvious flaws of the episode however (as en episode, not an adaptation) are elsewhere: Jon's return to the Wall, leaving by ship, ending up on the wrong side of the gate, hundreds of miles from the shore, all for the sake of ONE DRAMATIC PAUSE before Ser Alliser lets them in. It's not a crime, but it shows the amount of thought our beloved storykillers put in this. Then we have the attack on Daenerys - with a bunch of characters around who shouldn't be there, Hizdahr Zo Loraq somehow innocent and dead, and a legion of assassins surrounding her extremely story-pampered grace (where's the \"let's put all those cholera infested poor people in the city\" bit? Wouldn't want her to look stupid, right?). The legion of assassins however, falls into a hallucinatory time vortex and reappear in a 1988 action movie, starring Steven Seagal. They are therefore forced to attack one at a time, slowly. Right after Jorah unlikely winning some duels because he fought poorly but no one killed him. (who'll win, the Meereenese or the Westerosi? Oh look, unlike the previous duel there are 4 more contesters who weren't announced).Lastly, we have the Arya story, which is fairly good, and Dorne. Where the sand snakes keep behaving like 4 year olds (seriously, their dialogue is uncharacteristically bad), and Doran Martel may at some point explain his designs to someone. It seems to me like they're just using this storyline as filling until they decide how to change it, probably for the worse.I'm not giving it 1 star because it's not bad TV. It's an objectively sloppily written episode and I think to a lot of people who love the books, especially us Stannis fans, it is an unforgivable, pointless and very poorly (if at all) justified betrayal of the original material.",

                    "content": "The show's run of ninth episodes have been consistently excellent, either relying on a shocking and emotional character death or an elongated battle sequence. The Dance of Dragons, whose title is a play on the latest novel in George R.R. Martin's source material series, takes the two conventional episode nine structures and mashes them together, not unlike the ways in which Aegon and Rhaenyra Targaryen fought in the titular Dance of Dragons, set decades before the show's time frame. This historic battle provides the framework for the episodes two most notable scenes; Shireen's sacrifice and Dany's reopening of the fighting pits, both of which I'll get to later. There's bound to be controversy surrounding the former, a narrative twist I would like to immediately defend, but if the Game of Thrones following has any justice left, no-one will attack the events of the episode's closing sequence. Because that was just awesome.The Dance of Dragons hits its stride after we leave the Wall and Braavos and Dorne, as the episode's final half hour lies solely with Stannis and Dany. This episode saw Stannis suffer an attack from Ramsay and his men overnight, leading to him succumbing to Melisandre's cruel plan to sacrifice his daughter Shireen to the Lord of Light. This is unquestionably a horrific ordeal to watch, and director David Nutter's notion of filming the faces of those watching rather than the victim suffering isn't a far cry away from the framing of Sansa's rape back in episode six. It's already been proclaimed that this was entirely out of character, for Stannis to sacrifice and burn his own daughter at the stake, but I fail to believe this. Stannis was, after all, introduced as a man so insistent on taking the throne that he murdered his own (innocent) brother in cold blood, and willingly sent hundreds of men to their death after the wildfire explosion in Blackwater Bay. Every time Stannis has been backed into a corner, he has relied on and taken Melisandre's advice, and it is entirely justified that he would do so again, now that he's in his most difficult corner yet.Earlier in this season, Stannis and Shireen had a heartfelt moment in which Stannis told her the story of how he saved her from Greyscale, and proudly declared her as his daughter and someone whom he loves. Perhaps bis uneventful time the Wall softened viewers to Stannis, a man who, let's face it, has shown repeated signs of bordering on insanity. When placed in that context, it is Stannis and Shireen's nicer scene that feels more out of character than his sacrifice of her. The show rarely portrays Stannis in a positive light (there isn't much there to portray, after all), and for him to burn his own daughter at the stake feels entirely true to both his character and his motives, as difficult as it is to watch. And that it is, I'd place this only a fraction below the emotional weight of the infamous Red Wedding, this time two seasons ago. We knew what Stannis planned as soon as he sent Davos away, so for Shireen to unknowingly offer herself up for the sacrifice was a heartbreaking scene, followed only by her sudden realisation and ultimate demise. Screaming for her parents whilst she burns alive, Kerry Ingram (Shireen) gave the performance of the season in the show's most emotionally devastating sequence in years; a moment that will not be forgotten easily.But it is followed by a sequence that, whilst far from the emotional weight of Shireen's death, is arguably the most intense fight the show has offered. And this is coming just one week after Hardhome, which, despite being the larger and more surprising fight, didn't have anywhere near as much at stake. After Jorah won his battle in the fighting pits, he throws a spear directly towards Dany, only for it to impale an incoming Son of the Harpy warrior. This immediately escalates into a full blown fight, with Dany and her company stranded in the middle of the arena, surrounded by attackers. As Dany takes Missandei's hand (the shot that stuck in my mind the most), she closes her eyes, and then we hear it. Dany and Drogon's relationship has been rocky for a while now, but it only seems right that he would come to save her in her most dire moment. Drogon fends off the attackers while taking a few spears himself, but when Dany approaches him he screeches at her. This was the moment that both Dany and the viewer understood the same thing; if she doesn't get him out of there, he will kill everyone, including the likes of Tyrion, Jorah, and Missandei. In what I can only describe as the most breathtaking moment of the entire show, Dany climbs atop of Drogon and leads him to the sky.And, for some reason, I found this really emotionally affecting. Dany has been my favourite character in this show for quite some time now, and to see her and Drogon together in such a way hit me harder than I imagined it would. They fly off together, leaving her company (and the audience) stood in awe at what they've just seen. This has been a slow season for Game of Thrones, but it was needed after the bloodbath that was season four. Every ounce of character work and narrative setup has led to this episode, and it exceeded any expectation I had of it. Every now and then, a television episode comes along that is all entertaining, thrilling, emotional and shocking. The Dance of Dragons managed this seamlessly, delivering the best hour of television so far this year.",

A rangers approach is signaled by a horn blast in previous seasons. Why was Stannis's Navy dropping the Wildlings on the same side of the Wall as the Whitewalkers, who are coming to attack the wall? Who did the Wildlings escape from? That entire scene was shown in error.Stannis at the camp fire cookout. How did his camp in a snowstorm get set on fire. We must be that stupid, thinking that they couldn't have tracked their enemies through the snow after they had left a trail of fire. Selyse flopping on the ground bleating badly just like Catelyn Tully going comatose. They really know how to set up those award winning scenes. Wrong. Try again please, it is insulting. Try using just a little bit more anguish and despair, screaming in heart wrenching agony. Not Blaahh! Prompting me to laugh loudly. At least Davos wasn't around. Guess why?Two snakes in that cell, the other one was not in the picture. Although the third snake, said, slut. Mc-in's-ley did you not understand the humour intended? Slut being a medieval term that was never spoken.Oldtown is in Dorne, Oldtown contains the Citadel. The Citadel is where every maester learns alchemy acquiring their chain. Maester's keep ravens, send ravens. Dorne has no knowledge of any current events happening in Kingslanding. No they didn't.Which seat was going to be taken? Doran was sending both Elleria and Trystane away. Although I couldn't care less if the plot stunk. Possibly why he threatens Elleria? It was not called the small council because it allows boy's to rule, otherwise Tommen would. Which seat is currently available?That idiot with a broom handle, it does not look like a Greataxe, functioning only as a broom. Every other Dorne scene queue the fat guy with a broom, does nothing apart from holding a broom for all of it's usage.Within Braavos the age rating has been lowered into vinegar, leaving a sour taste. Licensed premises don't have guards. Assassins training, need to play dress up instead of mastering their faceless arts. Has she learned lying, or are we also that stupid? No guards are seen in Braavos, because they all went off fighting in Meereen.Danaerys in previous seasons, Dany had ordered all of the harpy statues to be destroyed.Who was that stupid announcer, watch his stupid nuance for more screen time, having to be ushered away from his ceaseless prattling.There is no weapon master anywhere that twirls their weapons in stupid circles, spinning their weapons pointlessly. Unless wielding a spun weapon like a flail. When twirling a blade it can easily be knocked out of the grip by any opposing striking counter force. Every stupid combat scene in this show, starts with that same ridiculous style of spin the weapon. It is not cool, it was not a Kata, which would see flowing strikes and functioning stances, those weapons aren't nunchaku. The first idiot started their combat with a two-handed sword, he spun this around in a complete 360 degrees. That Greatsword didn't function, the weight was wrong for the handle, it was unbalanced for any combat used. Then the other guy just stood there. The Braavos fencer, didn't jab and parry, he sliced also just stood there. The spear, halberd, was spun ridiculously instead of using it's reach to jab and keep enemies outside of range. Instead he spun the weapon in cartwheels stepping into an opponents attack, who ducked and jabbed killing that twirling weapon.Launch fire. Lanuching fire would be done in the same way that Wildfire was lobbed by a grenade. Have you had read the books? What happens in a riot, they are surrounding their foes? Rioters set something ablaze, throwing it, at least throwing other projectiles. If creating fire was so stone-age? Rioters throw projectiles in a riot, or launch fire, causing their foes to break their formation.Drogon psychically teleported. I do not have to reiterate the big firecloud in the sky before he entered appearing in flight. Dany didn't speak summoning him via speech, it was telepathic.There was wood above the stadium, there was wood all around the base of the stadium in the central fighting pit, there was a wooden structure containing seats for the queen and her counsel where they were sitting. Something should have been burning and not out. A dragon launches fireballs, using its flame-breath raining an inferno of destruction. Dragon fire melting even stone, in Harrenhal. Watching that flame thrower used, it hasn't burnt anything. There are still plenty of Harpies. However these Harpies were finally throwing objects that they weren't prior.That stupid ride, the stupid roar, her stupid garb. She married a dragon instead of actually continuing this story. My smart TV would get broken from this rubbish, if it tries looking for something smarter to watch. This media here has been manipulated, looking at the percentage of reviews, gauging, how these ratings have been affected.",

                    "content": "I didn't think they'd be able to match the quality of last week's episode \"Hardhome\", but here we are! \"The Dance of Dragons\" is without a doubt one of the most suspenseful and shocking episodes we've had so far - for a multitude of reasons...Firstly, I was surprised that Ramsay Bolton's \"attack\" on Stannis was over in under sixty seconds, and that we didn't actually see him or his twenty men, however it set up a decision for later on in the episode which I understand some took to disagreeing with.Jon Snow lets the Wildings through Castle Black and Ollie shoots him a nasty look - what is he planning? I fear that all of Jon's hard work may quickly be undermined by this young boy and his hatred for those who butchered his family.Arya's storyline is much more interesting in this episode as she's torn between her desire to become no-one and to please the Many-Faced-God, yet she's also oh-so-eager to cross some names off that wonderful little list of hers. I'm interested to see what her final decision will be: stick to her given task or go off and get her revenge.And what of Stannis' storyline? Well, I can't say his decision surprised me. Stannis has victory and the Iron Throne on his mind, and he will stop at nothing to get what he sees his destiny to be - as this episode clearly evidences. He sacrifices his own daughter Shireen to the Lord of Light in order to aid his war efforts and take Winterfell from the Boltons. I have to ask: were some people honestly surprised by this? Have you been paying any attention at all? This is Game of Thrones - nobody is safe:\"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention.\"Stannis murdered his own brother back in season two, sent thousands to their deaths in the Battle of Blackwater, forced his men to march on Winterfell despite the imminence of winter, and he even cut off the fingers of Davos! Surely nobody could possibly be surprised that he would sacrifice his own daughter? Especially since Melisandre repeatedly proves that her visions are true and the Lord of Light is powerful. Stannis is undoubtedly one of the most ruthless men in Westeros, so if you thought this was out of character for him, either start paying more attention or just stop watching altogether.The Fighting Pits: Daenerys, Jorah the explorah, Tyrion, The Sons of the Harpy, and Drogon. What more could you want? The duel with Jorah was exhilarating to watch. I truly thought for a second that Daenerys would stop the fight and have Jorah saved. I also thought that if she didn't intervene Jorah would surely die. I was wrong on both accounts: Jorah wins and expertly (and startlingly, I might add) throws a spear and kills a Son of the Harpy getting too-close-for-comfort to Daenerys. At this point, the Sons of the Harpy reveal themselves and the horror unfolds; the panic sets in and the bloodshed begins. It seemed hopeless for Daenerys and her allies, trapped in the middle of the pit, surrounded by far too many foes for them to take alone. And just when it was almost over, when she closed her eyes and held hands with Missandei, the electrifying screech of Drogon echoes and our hearts skip a beat. He comes to the rescue and sends the Sons of the Harpy running with flames at their feet. And then we are rewarded with something I never thought we'd see - Daenerys riding Drogon. I never thought she'd ever be able to, or would, but she did. And boy was that perfect. She truly is the Mother of Dragons - although that being said, at this point it seems appropriate for her to free Viserion and Rhaegal (her other two dragons, currently chained up) after this very close call.After what was a very gradual build-up for this season, I feel that it has paid off superbly considering last week's \"Hardhome\" and this week's episode. In addition, we didn't get any of King's Landing this week, which means we have that to look forward to next week in the season finale. And with all the tension building in King's Landing, this could make for the best season finale we've ever had in Game of Thrones.",

At least the other players believe in themselves and not in some god that ask you to kill your daughter.

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Fans have expressed dissatisfaction at the general quality of Season 5. While it was definitely the weakest season up to this point of 'Game of Thrones' (only because the previous four seasons were so good), was not perfect and didn't settle straightaway, there was also a lot to like about the whole season and all the episodes. To me all the episodes, although some were better than others (with \"The Gift\" and especially the season's magnum opus \"Hardhome\" the best and \"Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken\" being the weakest), all were good to outstanding. \"Mother's Mercy\" for me is one of the lesser season finales, again because the previous ones' quality were so strong, and is one of the weaker episodes of the season. It is far from a bad season finale at all, in fact, although the most polarising among fans (it was acclaimed by critics), from personal opinion it is very good with its best elements terrific. It also has a couple of things that frustrate, which stops it from being the going out with a bang finale and being a near-one instead. Have to agree with those who found the episode was rushed at times. This is particularly true with the storylines for Sansa and Stannis, both being too hurriedly paced, featured in too short a time and didn't feel particularly well rounded off. The Dorne storyline is certainly the most interesting and most plot advancing it was all season by some considerable distance. My negative opinion of the Sand Snakes hasn't changed though sadly with them fitting pretty awkwardly here, and in this episode they have a line, mentioned already in a few reviews already so won't repeat as it makes me cringe even thinking about it, that by 'Game of Thrones' standards is just embarrassing.On the other hand, there are two standout scenes in a good way. Jon's fate is very powerfully done, it has the intense shock factor and did reduce me to tears and shock. Even more impactful is Cersei's atonement, that was powerful stuff. The dark tone was handled with both intensity and poignancy and the bleak twists and strong characterisation (especially Cersei, Jon and Arya, Cersei having the most impact on me in a while).It does a great job in setting things up for the next season, even if it's not the most story or character progressing episode in 'Game of Thrones' history.Uniformly, the acting (always a strength in 'Game of Thrones') is faultless. In \"Mother's Mercy\", it's Lena Headey who takes the top honours in a masterclass performance. Kit Harrington also delivers some of his best acting as Jon.Visually, \"Mother's Mercy\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Mother's Mercy\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.There are numerous signs of thought-provoking, balanced and layered writing, though there are problems here (especially that Sand Snakes line) and the story grips. All in all, very good but for a season finale somehow one naturally does expect more, especially when \"Hardhome\" two episodes before was such a special episode and a turning point for the season. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

This episode is all about tying up plot lines from this season of the show, with real surprises and resolution in the Sansa, Jon and Stannis storylines in particular. Some of it does appear rushed, with the long-expected Ramsey vs. Stannis battle in particular chock full of mistake and a real lack of realism; a shame that Stannis had to be got rid of in such a quick and off-handed way. Still, the show makes up for it elsewhere, contributing the last really gruesome shot we'll get alongside a real gut-punch of a season climax.",

The way of Samwel to a new beginning is the basic source of hope.

The betrayal of the Night Watch is the most impressive moment of this show. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Mother's Mercy\"",

                    "content": "As with the previous few seasons, the return of Game of Thrones was much heralded by the press and marketing material, although I was already looking forward to it and needed not too much help. With the television show now reaching the point (or beyond) of the books, then risk of spoilers online dropped to only cover the 18 or so hours from US broadcast until I watched it in the UK \u2013 not a big deal but a show that so often lives off big shock moments and development is obviously better when you let these hit you as they were intended rather with pre-knowledge of them.Ironically this is a little less true of this fifth season than the former ones, and I think a lot of the so-so reception for this season is based around the fact that, while the story telling remains solidly good, there is a distinct lack of big events and twists when compared to previous seasons. In particular the first half of the season doesn't have too many larger moments of this ilk, which I did not find too much of a problem since I found the professional story-telling to be pretty engaging throughout. The amount of characters being juggled continues to be a challenge that the show deals with as well as could be expected, although there are still lots of open questions. Some of these spill over from the fourth season (there are characters still \"in play\" that we do not see even once in this season), but also within the season itself we have characters such as Margaery who get into tight spots but then are really not mentioned again for the second half of the season. This is not to say that the show is not still engaging, but it does struggle with all those spinning plates. It does know when to give over more time though, and it produces several big moments in the final few episodes, which add a lot of needed energy and event into the season. Specifically the white walkers, and the Harpy attack in the fighting pit stand out; the only downside of these being that they really feel like \"big moments\" rather than an extension of the whole show \u2013 standalone rather than organically connected.The season had a lot of criticism online about some aspects of the delivery; since I try to avoid spoilers I only really understood this once I had finished the season, but have to admit that I agree with many of the comments about the show's treatment of the female characters. Cruelty and sexual violence is common across all the characters, but there does seem to be a greater focus on it when it is towards women; I do not know if this is from the books or not, but it can be troubling at times. Likewise, the introduction of some very strong female characters (Sand Snakes) very quickly moves to their sexuality, with a scene in the jail being gratuitous in its nudity. It is not a new problem with the show but it does seem that all of the actresses will have to accept some nudity at some point. This aside though, the more difficult moments are rewarding and fit the show \u2013 I like the horror of it, I enjoy the cruelty of the writing towards the audience in particular. It also manages to keep the characters interesting, and while Snow, Tyrion, Jorah, Daenerys, Arya, and the like continue to be my favorite characters, I very much enjoyed Stannis this season \u2013 a wonderfully tragic character in so many ways.The fifth season may not be as strong as previous, and it may be a bit more fragmented when it comes to big moments and their link to the story-telling, however it does still continue to work. It is not without problems in the content and tone, but it engages and holds out many more good stories and threads as we look towards the sixth season \u2013 the real challenge being how they can balance them better, deliver on them all, and continue to deliver the bigger impacting moments as part of the whole.",

In Braavos Arya manages to kill Meryn Trant but her satisfaction is short lived; his death was not sanctioned by the Many-faced God so there will be a heavy price to pay. In Meereen Jorah Mormont and Daario Naharis leave to search for Daenerys leaving Tyrion to run the city. Meanwhile Daenerys is far to the north with her sick dragon; here she finds herself surrounded by a Dothraki hoard.Back in Westeros Jaime and Bronn sail from Dorne but relief soon turns to despair for Jaime when his daughter collapses; poisoned by Ellaria Sand. North of Winterfell Stannis learns that half his army have departed and his wife has hanged herself; then Melisandre abandons him leaving him to face the Bolton's army with just a small number of foot soldiers. In Winterfell Sansa and Theon take drastic measures to get away from Ramsey. Further south in King's Landing Cersei confesses to one of the crimes she has confessed to and is forced to undergo a humiliating penance. At Castle Black Sam departs with Gilly before Alliser Thorne confronts Jon Snow in one of the series' most shocking moments to date.This was certainly one of the most downbeat series finale's to date; indeed it looks as though many major characters have died\u0085 although the fact that we didn't always see the moment of death leaves open the possibility that some will survive. It will be a long wait to find out! Thankfully it wasn't all depressing; it was good to see Sam and Gilly leave Castle Black and the reunion of Tyrion and Varys was equally pleasing. The fact that the story visited each of the protagonists did mean we didn't get to stay with any of them long which was a pity but something that couldn't really be helped as none of the sections seemed superfluous. The cast did a fine job; particular mention much go to Lena Headey; her performance was brilliant and brave as Cersei is humiliated and forced to walk naked through the streets of King's Landing; there was nothing erotic about her nudity and for once it was hard not to feel sympathy for Cersei. Overall I'd say this was a cracking conclusion to a fairly solid season; I look forward to Season Six.",

                    "content": "Well I think Game of Thrones can now be considered the most miserable show I have ever seen. Yes, I love this show. It's incredibly well-written and is consistently the most shocking series every year, but I feel like the show doesn't have to be this much of a bummer every week. But I guess I asked for it. Because last week was a bit of a letdown in terms of the amount of surprising things that happened, this week picked up for it.We began in the North where Stannis and his men are losing people by the second but they decide to march on anyway. Even after Melisandre surprising leaves, Stannis gave Winterfell one last shot. For all he has done in this show good or bad, I think he was just a man trying to fulfill his destiny. For awhile I thought he was the most fit for the throne, and even to an extent up until his death. But seeing Brienne finally get her revenge for Remly was good enough. Now that Stannis is dead, and his wife killed herself, are there any Baratheon's left? Especially considering Tommen is really a Lannister. No matter, I was somewhat disappointed that they didn't actually show Stannis' death and cut away to Ramsay killing more people. Moving onto Winterfell, we finally saw Theon AKA Reek redeem himself and save Sansa. By the way, how can they possibly survive that fall? Onto another Stark, Arya had quite the night. Her bada** turn felt a little too quick but was nonetheless exciting to finally see her get revenge on somebody from her list, much different than letting the Hound die for himself last year.But as you may have predicted, Jaqen H'ghar knew what Arya was up to and seemingly made her pay for her failures. This was yet another incredible scene and one that didn't have too much closure. I don't think she's dead but the Arya we know and love is sure to have changed forever. We then got a brief scene with Jaime leaving Dorne. His moment with Myrcella was very sweet as he finally embraced who he actually is to his own daughter. That is until the poison from Ellaria Sand kicked in and killed her. I expect to see an all out war next season between the two families (once again, nothing's ever happy for people in this show). Back in Meereen, we had perhaps the only pleasant scene all night as Tyrion and the gang decide what to do without their queen. I quite enjoyed the scene and really like where it's heading. Especially now knowing Varys is back in the equation. Dany on the other-hand looks to be heading down a similar path as season 1 as she was presumably captured by the Dothraki. But I think she is much better prepared than she was all those years back. All this to digest and the two biggest scenes I haven't even talked about yet.Back in King's Landing, it was time for Cersei Lannister to pay due for her crimes, but did any of us expect this much embarrassment? Her atonement included being stripped of everything she has protected for years. She quite literally bared everything that Cersei stood for. I wonder if this will be similar to when Jaime lost the hate back a few seasons and we start to root for the character? No matter, I know one thing, it was darn impossible not to feel for her while she walked blocks nude and endured as much physical pain as mental pain. As we had back to the Wall, Jon Snow has already said goodbye to Sam as he heads for the Citadel, and now he finds out that Stannis has died and Melisandre has returned to presumably re-up her mission with Snow, another royal blood. Little did I know that the Olly kid would betray and turn him over to the rest of the watch to murder him. By far the most heartbreaking death I have watched on this show. Jon Snow is one of the only genuinely good guys in the show. It seemed like there was insane amount of potential with his character (considering the R+L=J theory). But as Game of Thrones too often does, his death came far too soon. It's by far the biggest Game of Thrones episode to date. So much happened and so much was set up. In many ways, this was the episode that last week could have been. I just hope that one day this show lets the good guys win. Most deaths make sense, I'm just not seeing the point of Snow's death. The North Remembers.+Wrapped a ton of stories up +Non-stop paced +Revenge & redemption for some +Funny and pleasant Meereen scene +Fitting end to an otherwise down year+Cersei pays +Sweet Jaime scene...-...Only to end miserably -Can the good guys ever win? We will miss you Snow 9.5/10",

That whole sequence at the end of ep.9 with dragon was just amazing - special effects, music, cinematography - it was epic in every meaning of this word, true \"blockbuster\" type of scene. Episode 10 finally gave us some big events. That Lena Headey's \"walk of shame\" was jaw-dropping, truly a brave performance, with some of the best editing and cinematography the series have ever had. The ending was ... lets just say in style of \"Game of Thrones\". It left me speechless for a moment. Overall, episodes 9 and 10 are solid 10/10. Overall season 5 wasn't that great as lets say 4th, but it's a show with production values and story to witch nothing currently on a small screen market can not even start to comparing. If season 5 had it's weak moments, they were simply weak in comparing to the \"Game of Thrones\" show overall. And there is something to it.",

He does not have much spotlight this season, his time is spent mostly on brooding and bantering. It's a breath of fresh air when he's embraced by his flesh and blood.

However, Daenerys herself is in foreign territory, although a lot of strangers clamoring around her is not particularly new for her.The episode, and season, ends with tragic public prosecution of Cersei and Jon Snow. Cersei takes a literal walk of shame as she is humbled in public. It's admittedly hard to witness as her rigid defense is gradually crumbling, but this might just fuel more hatred for next season. Meanwhile, Jon Snow is unfortunately as cold as his name implies.This season has been nice in all the darkest ways. See you next time.",

                    "content": "Pacing. It's an extraordinary difficult thing to do in a show of such large scale. So many locations, characters and story lines, so little time. Mother's Mercy doesn't actually have any filler. The task of tying up season 6 is almost too much to ask. It's throughout the season though that many events have gone through a jarring editing process that leaves me slightly unsatisfied despite so much content in this finale. Stannis Baratheon. Always a polarising character, none more so than last week when he burned his own daughter to take Winterfell. Reasoning aside and a horrifyingly done (in a good way) burning scene, D&D never really built up the sense of urgency or dire circumstances he was in. Cold, snowed in, little food and even less morale? Why not give a scene to a few weakened soldiers disparaging their chances? Or a few more instances of freezing horses and soldiers lining up for a miserable bowl of gruel? Instead we get more exposition stuffed inside a tent with a broody Stannis staring at the maps. We don't get the sense of urgency or despair which drives him to sacrifice his only heir (good plan). There's only so much that Dillane can do when a large scale battle is reduced to a skirmish inside woods, much like last season with the wildling ambush. Why not give his story more than 3 episodes in the snow to establish the bleak setting and a sense of desperation? As a result there's no weight to the news of half his army deserting, or Selyse hanging herself. The cutting of the battle has better prospects for Ramsay despite there being no real action (where's Roose?). It's tiresome to see him so invincible. Rheon is an incredible actor but is now seldom called upon to do little more than be the cruel sadist that was so effective earlier. He can fight off the best of the Iron Islands shirtless, and with a few men completely derail Stannis' campaign (a guy known for holding Storm's End for a whole year). What he can't do is stop Reek and Sansa escaping. It might have come a little out of the blue but I loved the effect of Myranda going splat on the ground. Hopefully better things in store for them. Arya in Braavos took another big step this episode. Her story has been the most well paced this season. It's the end of a satisfying arc as she infiltrates the brothel and finally ticks off another name on her list. The death is well shot and uses makeup to great effect. The bloodied head of Trant looks realistic and Williams' acting is perfect. You sense that she is becoming a faceless man in her language and mannerisms even when her kill is purely the desire of Arya Stark. Her punishment for taking Trant's life is blindness. Even with the sort of dramatic wording and regime that most people would shy away from, Arya has really grown this season. Siddig's Doran has been great but his actions say otherwise. He makes no attempt to hide his disdain for Ellaria's revenge but there's nothing adamant about how freely he lets them wander around or you know, kiss the girl they've been wanting to kill the entire season. It's such a emotionally empty attempt at shock value despite the Myrcella and Jaime confession scene (well done considering this is like their 3rd conversation ever). Ten episodes gave us a very weak kidnapping climax and a lot of moping around in dungeons and angry talk. It makes sense from Ellaria's POV (even with Oberyn explicitly saying that the Dornish do not kill little girls) but storyline wise it's such a pointless thing to happen. With Cersei incapacitated for the time being, the Lannister name in shambles and Tyrell support gone there's little chance of a war happening. Myrcella dying is supposed to be a very significant event but all I can see is it's effects fizzling out with so much more happening in King's Landing. And how the hell did Tyene's line to Bronn make the final screenplay???Cerei's walk of penance was done extraordinarily well. Lena Headey may be one of the more underrated actresses in the show but it's a whole lot of work to make everyone hate you. Those grimaces, the poisonous glances at Marg, the thin veil of courtesy behind a smouldering wreckage of hate and ambition. Headey's face shows none of these as she makes the walk of atonement to the Red Keep. She's stripped of both her clothes and her pride, barely enduring the endless taunts and jeers of \"whore\" and \"brotherf*cker\" plus a few more very explicit displays of mockery. It's a testament to Headey to be able to show the breakdown of Cersei without the physical acting; the digital cut-and-paste of her face is quite seamless especially if you aren't looking for it. And who's that underneath the helmet of the new Kingsguard member? Perhaps the Lannisters aren't in dire straits just yet. Kevan is back to take control of things (where's Tommen). For the Watch what each man utters as they stab Jon in the stomach. It's a credible reason if not for the events of Hardhome which make the WW situation all that dire. Why has Jon not told anyone other than Sam? What about the dozen men that accompanied and witnessed it all? Has Dolorous Edd suddenly evaporated? And why in god's name is Olly uttering the phrase after so little time at the Wall and being the first person guilty of stabbing Jon for his own personal reasons? Perhaps it was wrong to have that incredible scene ahead of this betrayal. It's disturbingly poignant if not for the very credible explanation that Jon seems to not want to give. Season 6 was maybe a slight misstep. May the Lord of Light guide us back onto the rightful path.",

Would Arya forget her name and become a nameless face? Will Jon Snow return from the grave after his death? Will Sansa and Reek find another way to escape the clutches of Ramsay Bolton? All of the questions will be answered in Season 6. For now, the performances are still great, the story/script is still well-written, the pacing, while a bit rushed, is fine for the most part, the directing is superb, the music score is still beautiful in it's atmosphere, the sets are lavish, the costumes are neat, the scenery is still gorgeous to look at, and the editing is sharper. So, overall, another great episode and a solid cliffhanger to Season 6.",

I'm not saying that it's terrible or anything like that, this is still a good season but not the best one. You may disagree with me on this one, but I haven't seen anyone saying that this they favorite season, well must of the people are saying that this is they least favorite one and they die hard fans of the show and so I'm I. These a lot of good and some flaws in this season.All the cast in the show all do fantastic as always. It's a big cast and me naming them off will take forever, but once again the biggest stand out was Tyrion Lannister played by Peter Dinklage and Jon Snow played by Kit Harington. Every since the beginning of the show they been impressing me with they outstanding performance's. Both of them are my favorite character's, until last nights episode when one of them got killed and if you seen the final episode of season 5 you will know what I mean. But anywhere all the cast did great.The best episode of season 5 and probably the whole season is the episode called Hardhome, Oh my god this episode was both intense and terrifying. The episode was nightmare worthy and freaked me out, I mean winter has came and it was scary as hell. And the episode has a scene with Tyrion and Daenery and they scene was my favorite between the two, I mean Tyrion putting some sense into her head is probably the best thing I've seen this season, because I was starting to hate Daenery a bit for everything she's done and how much of a terrible leader she is. I'm happy that Tyrion is there to tell her how you should do it. But this season has in my opinion the weakest episode in the whole season and that was Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken. I know some people hated that episode as well just because of that rape scene and I hear a lot of defending it by saying stupid things like: \"Oh these been rape, beheading, people being cut in half and being burned alive in the past season's, but this is the episode where every lose they sh*t. It's fictional, it's not real, get over it\". Okay let me just tell you this, to those who are defending the rape scene and saying get over you sound like a real ass hat for saying stupid sh*t like that, I mean get over it? rape isn't something to get over it, even it's frictional rape is still effective. Yes they was rape that happened before in the past seasons but that as well almost stopped me from watching it by watching the first episode of the first season. Now that's not the only thing why I think that episode was poor was because it was boring, dull and nothing special at all.Now overall I still think that is a good solid season, just not the best compared to the others.",

                    "content": "I have read many comments about GAME OF THRONES season 5 finale: from excellent to outstanding to downright predictable and boring. I tend to stick with the first. I, like many other viewers of this show, have become addicted to the story in the seven kingdoms. There's some serious advancement in the multiple storyline: Jon Snow dies stabbed to death by his own Night's Watch brothers, Arya becomes a pupil of the Many Faced God only to be left apparently blind, Stannis Baratheon finally realizes that all those prophecies Melisandre raved about are untrue and that his daughter's sacrifice turned out to be the finest example in futility. Tyrion Lannister forges an alliance with Daenerys Targaryen, who is left by her dragon in the middle of nowhere while escaping a coup in the city of Meereen. We see Daenrys being surrounded by hordes of Dothraki riders with the intention of kidnapping her. Meanwhile in Winterfell, Theon \"Reek\" Greyjoy and Sansa Stark make a desperate escape from Ramsay Bolton as he arrives from his winning battle with Stannis. Last but not least, we have Cersei Lannister's walk of \"atonement\", where the regent Queen mother of King's Landing is force to purge her sins in front of the city's population, naked and escorted by the brutal Septa Unella who whips a bell as she chants, \"shame\".It's the only scene I've heard friends say, \"poor Cersei\", or \"this is too much for her\". Apparently these friends have forgotten that it was Cersei who started all this mess by ordering her lover/brother Jamie Lannister to push young Brandon Stark off the window of a high tower. Until the army of the dead make it south of the wall, Cersei remains the main antagonist in the story, the main \"bad guy\" in GAME OF THRONES, even more so than the Boltons, or the treacherous Night's Watch brothers, or the fanatical Sons of the Harpy.I do feel however that some loose ends have to start veering in a more concrete way to their conclusions. 1. Sansa Stark - So far she's played the \"damsel in distress\" prototype. Season 6 has to make her transition into a tough as nails bitch. After the killing of almost her entire family, she needs to take the reigns and start plotting revenge on those who've wronged her family.2. Daenerys Targaryen - I understand that she needs to get to King's Landing in order to regain what' \"rightfully hers\" yet (as of episode 9, Season 5) she seems to be pretty comfortable in Meereen. What is she waiting for?3. Jon Snow - He is obviously NOT dead. You can't have so much build up on one character only to kill him off just like that. Why did Ned Stark never told him who his mother was? Why did the White Walker stared at him in the battle of Hardhome? Why did Melisandre tried to seduced him? Why did Maester Aemon told him to \"Kill the boy\"? Jon Snow's storyline will continue for sure!4. Cersei Lannister - She's defied almost everyone in her path, friend and foe alike, and it's been established that's she's been a raging bitch since she was a little girl (as seen on the first episode of season 5). It's a wonder no one has tried to poison her or kill her, yet her walk of atonement in season's 5 finale has been her embrace with pure, unadulterated humiliation. She will eventually slay those involved in her most disgraceful hour before someone finally slays her.5. Tyrion Lannister - My favorite character, will have to prove that his alliance with Daenerys must pay off with peace for the Seven Kingdoms, as Lord Varys has expressed.Forget the naysayers: \"Mother's Mercy\" was a great finale for season 5. I hope season 6 is even more exciting!",

In this season final, there are a few thrill kills, but with so many setbacks, brutal scenes and tragic endings, you are left feeling like \"Why?\"All of the characters's fates either end up uncertain, disempowered or in a tragic end. Absolutely none of them are happy endings. Arya manages to kill brutal child molester Meryn Trant, the first person on her hit list, but ends up going blind as a punishment for disobedience. Danaerys ends up surrounded by a horde of Dothraki horsemen who circle her. Theon does a good deed and kills Ramsey's female guard so he and Sansa can escape. But they are seen simply jumping off a tower into the snow, which is very dangerous. Stannis, who lost all sympathy after he sacrificed his own daughter for success, ends up on the losing side when he marches for Winterfell. He (seemingly) meets his end when Brienne of Tarth confronts him over his brother's (and her old king) murder.The ones who stick out the most is Cersei's Walk of Penance and Jon Snow's fate. Seeing Cersei naked, insulted and humiliated while walking through the city was hard to watch and very lengthy. And as for Jon Snow, well, it's basically the Red Wedding all over again. Just when you thought it couldn't get any nastier, it did. Do NOT watch if you're having a bad day.",

                    "content": "Game of Thrones is a show I've been binging the past few weeks. Needless to say, I'm awestruck. By its beauty in creating this rich fantasy world, by its strict attention to detail, by its clever storytelling, deep characters, and superb acting. Simply everything about this show has kept me locked in. At least, until the fifth season. I was becoming wary of the show's quality up until the episode Hardhome, which featured one of the greatest television scenes I've experienced in recent memory. It was then that my fears of an inferior season were gone. Most seasons up until this point have been slow burns, only elevating to epic heights in its final few episodes, and this season seemed no different. Unfortunately, the finale left a lot to be desired. While it's extraordinary by other TV standards, it's not up to par with previous finales and its flaws are too glaring to ignore.The writing in this episode feels choppy. There are so many story lines the show juggles simultaneously, and this is the only episode where I noticed it jumping from one story to the next, to the next, with little to no cohesion or fluidity. It's quite jarring, especially since many story lines come to an end in this episode. Moments that should feel impactful and dire merely come across as lazy and perfunctory. Arya's arc in this season essentially went nowhere, which was disappointing. Daenerys' scene was pointless and overlong, not to mention underwhelming following her epic actions in the previous episode. These scenes served little more than to break up the rest of the episode's momentum, offering no closure to the characters themselves, which is a shame considering how much I love them.Mother's Mercy does a few things right. Cersei's arc this season was one that came full circle in the most sensible and righteous way possible. She was finally stripped of power and forced to present her naked self to her people, both figuratively and literally. It was a heartbreaking scene, not because she didn't deserve it, but because of how raw and desperate Cersei has become. She was no longer the manipulative, conniving bitch we've come to know and love (to hate). Rather, she's presented a vulnerable wretch for the entire city to see. It's a powerful scene and one of the season's arcs that actually worked. Stannis also has his comeuppance, and although it makes sense from a practical standpoint, it's unfortunate that his character had to meet such a disgraceful end. He had become one of my favorite characters, and it was sad to see it all go to waste due to his stubbornness and failure to trust in himself. Though, from a character standpoint, these always were his weaker traits and it made sense that they'd result in his downfall.Jon Snow is the real talking point of the episode, and after watching the episode, I was speechless. I was seething at the fact that they killed off his character, the last of the Stark sons (not including the children), who has become the most honorable and likable character on the show. But again, from a practical standpoint, it makes perfect sense that his honor ended up getting him killed by his own people. From the point of view of the Night's Watch, Jon was a traitor, putting the lives of their enemies ahead of their own. However, as sensible as it may be, his death still infuriates me. He was a cornerstone of the show and I can't imagine it being the same without him.These pivotal scenes worked on their own, but in the context of this episode, their power was dampened. It was scene after scene of tying up loose ends, and after a while it became desensitizing. Still, the production value and performances alone elevate the episode into being a great watch. On the lower end of the GoT spectrum, sure. Shocking and infuriating, absolutely. But well-made television nonetheless.",

                    "content": "I was so angry at the previous episode's butchering of the story that I watched this one heavily prejudiced. A fair I think conclusion is that this season finale had some great moments (unsurprisingly those that were closest to book canon) and some others that could, even within the context of the vastly ruined show story lines, work quite powerfully except for one little thing: when they are not adapting material, Benioff and Weiss are proving increasingly incapable of avoiding black holes in the plot that even a toddler could spot. Exhibit 1: Shireen's sacrifice has melted the snows, allowing Stannis' leftover army to reach Winterfell. A couple of hours later. On foot. If that isn't a ridiculous trade-off I don't know what is.Now, again, it's not that it's different than the book. It's that the book version makes sense. Why did Melisandre sacrifice Shireen and not someone else of royal blood (they're still there in the show)? Why didn't she do the same spell that got rid of Renly? In the book, well, she isn't there. That makes sense. How do you explain that everything she had so far done in the show had worked and now she failed so miserably? Why is Ramsay Snow treated like some sort of Marvel Supervillain? Most importantly, how were the Boltons preparing for a siege and yet apparently kept a laughably large army inside the keep? Which the often praised for military prowess in previous episodes Stannis knew nothing about? These aren't small details; for a show of this budget, fame, production, I'm not letting you get away with such a horrible mess of a plot. Especially not when you could have avoided everything by sticking to the book. This sloppiness ruins even the, I will begrudgingly admit, fine moments of the Winterfell sequence, like Selyse's suicide. Because for every good moment, you get a \"suddenly Sansa can pick a lock\" or a \"totally unjustified by the script conversion of Reek\".But there was more than the Winterfell battle, thankfully. The Dorne story sees another divergence (though it was already so different it doesn't count much). At least this time the Dorne scenes advanced the plot a bit. But something needs to be done about the Sand Snakes. They cast a few beautiful and likely talented actresses and they are feeding them the most ridiculous lines - there was only one in this episode and I was rolling my eyes. The Arya storyline was quite good - the latter part was great (and faithful). The preceding murder of Meryn Trant was also a good piece of television except... did they really need to go to such lengths to demonstrate what a bad guy Meryn Trant is? This is the last place to go look for black and white morality. Arya wants revenge. You don't have to show us how justified it is. On the contrary, it would, I think, be much more powerful if we saw Meryn Trant being a nice guy and Arya still murdered him. The Meereen parts were a little meh. Nothing too spectacular, it's always good to see Varys even if his presence there seems a little convenient. Daenerys gets captures by a Khal, someone might have thought that since she was standing atop a high clifftop a few minutes before she would have seen a giant horde of Dothraki, but you'll say I'm overreacting. Cersei's walk of shame was a very powerful scene - though I dare say it was hard to fail at it, Lena Headey is a fine actress. I did see a subliminal self-criticism on the part of the show with the constant monotone of \"shame\".And then we have Jon Snow's murder (?). Finely handled as well, I won't complain (no Melisandre warning here of course, but doesn't matter). I suspect all those obvious hints with Ollie in previous episodes might have removed the surprise element for those who didn't know, but maybe not.All in all, I didn't really like season 5. Up until episode 8 it was certainly good but hardly compared to the previous years except for a few scenes (e.g. in Hardhome). Episode 9 was in my opinion a catastrophic, resounding failure on all levels of plot development. The finale uses a few of the book's climaxes to good effect but I am not sure a story so far removed and so poorly conceived at many of its original branches can stand.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Although it is a long way from being the best, or one of the best, season openers for 'Game of Thrones', Season 6 starts off very promisingly. It is easy to see why it has been positively reviewed by critics but also why it is divisive among fans and book fans. It does depart from the source material, especially in its treatment of Doran, even though somebody who always judges adaptations on their own terms not doing anything further with such an interesting character in the source material with more to give was a missed opportunity. There are certainly far better episodes in the season and of 'Game of Thrones' in general, but to me \"The Red Woman\" was very good, though with a couple of reservations. \"The Red Woman\" is at its weakest with the Dorne storyline. It was one of the biggest problems with the previous season and there is not much improvement. It is not particularly interesting and some of it is even cartoonish. Even more disappointing was its cheap treatment of Doran, one that was very rushed and abrupt and he deserved better.With such a lot going on in terms of story and character interaction, \"The Red Woman\" definitely would have benefitted from either being longer as an episode or having the events spread out as a two parter or something. Parts did feel hasty and it would perhaps have made the Dorne storyline better. A huge amount works here however. Character interaction-wise, faring best are Jaime and Cersei and in particular Sansa and Brienne, both intense and poignant. Loved what was done with Daenerys, even though brief, and felt sorry too for Arya. Davos shining more than he has been in a while was a plus as well. Another standout is the shock Melisandre reveal, that was harrowing. It is an episode that isn't action-heavy and doesn't advance existing storylines, with the main question on everyone's lips from \"Mother's Mercy\" being answered early on, but it sets up what is to follow well. 'Game of Thrones' has not faltered in the acting stakes and there is not a single bad performance. Standout performances are Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, Emilia Clarke and Maisie Williams, while Carice Van Houten gives her best acting to date.Visually, \"The Red Woman\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Red Woman\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking and there are no embarrassing lines this time (certainly not on the same level as that Sand Snake line in \"Mother's Mercy\". The storytelling mostly is passionate and sensitive, underwhelming only in Dorne. Overall, promising and very good. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

However, I was pleasantly surprised by a re-watch of this first episode. It's typically strong, with great production values, and it has a scene in Dorne which is actually impressive - bloodily so. There's a wealth of action and suspense in the individual scenes to enjoy, and you can tell the cast are champing at the bit to get on with it.",

Lord of the Rings had to have \"The Two Towers\" to get to the ending. We have several key figures moving into new directions with all moving toward an unspecified center. We know for sure that Theon is regaining his humanity, acting heroically. Sansa is with him and alive and a pawn in the game, but necessary. Cersei is back at the castle. We are still in the dark about how much power she has. How have these religious fanatics affected the empire. The new queen is in the dungeon, being asked to confess. Dany finds herself in the hands of a warrior society similar to the one she left when becoming mother of dragons. The princess returns to the castle with Jaime, dead. And back home the evil women have formed a coup and murdered the bridegroom and his father. Arya is totally blind and is beaten with a wooden rod and asked to defend herself. I'm sure her role will come into focus again. And, of course, Brienne and Pod come to the rescue of the escapees and they swear their allegiance to Sansa once again. She now has purpose again and is a worthy foe to anyone. I, myself, am not even slightly disappointed with the setup. Have some patience, people.",

Tyrion and Lord Vaeys are walking around in Meereen watching the people posing of merchants. Something strange happens with Melisandre. The return of \"Game of Thrones\" with \"The Red Woman\" shows many segments but along a short running time. The segments with Sansa and Doran are the best ones and the conclusion of the show is intriguing with the old woman. The other segments do not show anything new and are just to introduce the return of the characters. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"The Red Woman\"",

It is quickly confirmed that Jon Snow is definitely dead; Ser Davos and his allies at Castle Black must decide what to do next; knowing that Ser Alliser and the other members of the Watch who killed Jon will surely kill them too. Sansa and Theon are caught by Bolton troops but are then rescued by Brienne of Tarth and Podrick. Cersei vows to get revenge for the death of her daughter. Ellaria Sand and her Sand Snakes stage a coup in Dorne. Daenerys is the captive of Dothraki. Arya Stark is blind and begging on the streets when forced to fight an assailant who promises to fight her again the next day. Tyrion observes that tensions are high in Meereen before he sees the ships in the harbour ablaze.This episode might not be full of action but there are some moments; most notably when Brienne rescues Sansa but also some shocking moments of violence in Dorne. The way we only get brief glimpse of what happened to some characters may disappoint some viewers, especially those watching it straight after season five, however, having not watched season five for almost a year, I found this did what was required to reintroduce me to what had been happening without actually wasting time on a recap. There are also solid hints at what is likely to be happening later in the season and a surprising revelation about Melisandre, the titular 'Red Woman'. Overall a fine episode that quickly brought me back to the world of the 'Game of Thrones' and keen to see what happens in the rest of the series.",

                    "content": "After months of speculation, reading dozens of optimistic articles, scavenging for set photos, and reading every David and Dan say in interviews, Game of Thrones has finally returned. While it's far from the eventful episodes that finished off season 5, 'The Red Woman' set up what's to come this season, and I think we are in for one of the best seasons of Thrones yet.We began back at Castle Black where season 5 left off, as Jon Snow lie dead after being murdered. As expected, Davos finds his body and with the help of a few Night's Watch members, brings his body to safety. I'm glad they spent a good amount of time at the wall because that's ultimately what everyone wanted. We didn't get any real answers in terms of a resurrection, but we have to believe it's coming, right? Sadly, it seems as if Melisandre has given up all hope on anything and everything (seriously WTF to that final scene).Sansa, Theon, and now Brienne seem to be heading to Castle Black in what will probably be the most gratifying storyline of season 6. With Sansa out of danger and doing things on her own terms I think it will be very satisfying seeing what she does in the North. We may be in for a war of the north type outcome with the Bolton's also on their way to The Wall. I just hope the road trip doesn't take place over the entire season and Sansa gets to Castle Black within a few episodes, thus having the battle be mid-season and at the latest the end of the season. If the show is only going to go 8 seasons, story lines need to pick up the pace a bit.Speaking of road trips, Jaime's trip to Dorne definitely didn't turn out the way he planned as it ended with the tragic death of Myrcella. As if Cersei wasn't already going to kill everyone who ever wronged her, this death may put her over the top. Tommen is likely not far from biting it himself. But hey, at least Doran Martell died right? The other 'shame' victim would be that of Margaery, although not nearly at as much fault as Cersei was. Much like Sansa's trip to Castle Black, I hope Margaery finds her way out of that cell sooner or later and we can get back to bada** Natalie Dormer. Though if Cersei has anything to say about it, her days will be numbered.Lastly, Arya and Daenerys made brief appearances as well. It seems Arya will be having the rough end to the stick for the majority of the season before she inevitably gets her sight back (to a certain extent). I can't say I know exactly where her story will be taken this season nor do I know if it will really relate to the bigger picture at all, but more Arya is usually the better. Daenerys on the other hand, is taking a step back from her progress towards Westeros. As Tyrion put it \"I don't think the queen will be heading to Westeros anytime soon\". I don't like the fact that she is now in captivity with another Khal and her ships are burnt to shreds. I want this season to end with her heading to Kings Landing, and that seems way out of the realm of possibility at this point.In all, it was a set up episode for all intents and purposes but it sucked me back into the world of Thrones, and I'm instantly stoked for next week. I'm hoping each story moves at a nice pace to get us at a great place at the end of season 6. Everything this season seems to be leading towards multiple battles/wars, and that's what we want to see. Plus, we are one step closer to Jon Snow returning (fingers crossed). On a side note, does anyone else want Ghost to tear Alliser Thorne's face off?+Spent a good chunk of time at the wall+Davos to the rescue+Brienne & Sansa!+Dany takes a stand-But the ships being burnt slows down her plans8.1/10",

I'm not going to spoil anything to those who haven't seen it, so I'm just going to point out the flaws and positive aspects.The plot progression does get very slow and didn't advance some of the story lines left by the fifth season. Also, some of the characters were given little to do and weren't fleshed out enough. Maybe things will get better throughout the sixth season, but only time will tell. For now, everything else turned out fine.The performances are still good, especially Lena Headey who shines with her emotional performance, the script is fine for the most part, the directing is very solid, the scenery is still gorgeous, the sets and costumes are still lavish to look at, and the music score from Ramin Djawadi is very beautiful. So, overall, not great, but a good start to Season 6. :)",

However felt that they played it too safe, never really saw anything new or that was not easily predicted.So we see Jon Snow as dead and guarded by Ser Davos, Ghost and few others. We already knew that and still don't know the TRUE FATE of Jon Snow (still 9 Episodes left) Sansa and Theon on the run it was blatantly obvious their capture would be intervened and no surprise it was Brienne of Tarth. The only qualms I have is Pod, he could barley ride a horse not so many months ago and now he can fend off and kill a season soldier. Not just any soldier but ones sent out to look for Sansa (doubt Ramsey Bolton would have sent out idiots to bring them back)Dorne well we all knew that was on the cards with the Sand Snakes killing off Doran and Trystane Martell. This all leading to an all out war with the Lanasters.Daenerys well she is slave to Dothraki then released to be told that she will be sent to a palace full of khal widows (still no dragons to be seen).Finally Melisandre they only surprise though a partly predictable one. When the seen began with her looking in the mirror I KNEW she was about to transform (though admittedly not sure what it would be) then she turned into an old hag. Seeing that 99.99999999% of the time witches turn into old hags I wasn't too surprised. Good to see GoT back but hope the remaining 9 episodes have better surprises for us.",

                    "content": "Finally, GOT is back! Unfortunately, that's as excited as I get with Game of Thrones. Don't get me wrong, I love the show. I came in quite late, only watching the last 2 seasons week to week. The problem I have with Game of Thrones as a whole is that it is only 10 episodes and I find within a few weeks of the season finale, my hype for Game of Thrones has died down. So overall my excitement for this episode wasn't as high as it would be in compared to other shows such as The Flash. Into the episodes itself. I thought it was a well rounded episode that was a great way to bring us back into this story. With such a big gap, I always thought the first episode of the season was going to be them giving us a reminder of where everyone is at. First of all, it wouldn't be Game of Thrones without some deaths. Already on the season tally are 2 major deaths. While they weren't the biggest characters, the death of Doran and Trystane Martell was the typical Game of Thrones violence. I think this was a pretty smart decision to kill minor characters first up to get us back into the brutality of the show.I think the scene I really liked the most was the one with Tyrion and Varys walking around connecting with the people. Tyrion is by far my favourite character so it's always great to see him and I really like how he interacts with Varys. This really continues on from last seasons. I like how their humour bounces off each other and they have a sort of buddy cop sense to them.I've also had to touch and everything at Castle Black. I will admit I'm a little surprise we didn't get a whole lot of Jon Snow himself. It was more based around his death and I thought everything with Thorne was pretty interesting in how he managed to explain the actions and actually make good sense of the events. This is the story that I'm most interested in just purely on Jon Snow so I really hope they don't drag anything out too much. My second favourite moment in the episode was Arya. I really enjoyed Arya's story so far and bringing the blind factor was really interesting. I like how in this episode they didn't touch too much on it but just showed how her training is still going to continue. That makes me really excited that we might have a Daredevil style character in Arya.Finally, the Red Woman. I had a bit of YouTube going into this season just to refresh my memory on what has happened in the last season, and in this process I was really drawn into Ken Napzok and everything he has the say about the show. He really knows his stuff. One of the things he said was that he thinks the Red Woman isn't actually who we think she is. So that was really fresh in my mind so when it was revealed, I wasn't massively surprised. But either way, I thought it was a really nice reveal and if that thought wasn't fresh in my mind, I would of legitimately been surprised.Overall, I thought it was a great introduction back into the show. It really continued off the back season 5. Even through I wasn't completely excited for this season, this episode really made me excited again. What makes me excited most is that there is still so much we don't know about this season. I really hope we get to see Bran next episode because by far he was the part of season 5 I missed the most.8/10 - See more at thenotsonerdynerd.wordpress.com/",

                    "content": "The much anticipated sixth season of \"Game of Thrones\" is finally underway, and it marks the turning point in the series for both fans of the show and novel. From here, creators DB Weiss and David Benioff are free to take the series in whatever direction they please, and for the most part, the season premiere showcases a lot of potential. \"The Red Woman\" does a great job of re-establishing the whereabouts of most of the main characters and setting up the season to come. There is not much payoff in this episode, apart from a satisfying closure to the Sansa/Reek story that the finale of the fifth season was not willing to offer. Rather this episode leaves much to be longed for, and fans of \"Game of Thrones\" will undoubtedly be left for another week in anticipation. What I did notice while watching this episode was the addition of some more humour, which I personally felt did not work in the world that Weiss & Benioff have brought to the big screen. Near the beginning of the episode, in Mereen, there is a fantastic sequence between Tyrion and Varys, which showcases the excellent ability of the writers to inject humour. Yet, a lot of the forceful humour in the rest of the episode do not work for me. As far as acting, music, cinematography and pace are concerned, they are all very strong. While there is impressive camera-work that gives the show an epic feel, I could not help but feel that some of the sets looked abnormally fake for an episode that would have taken close to $10 million to produce. Where this should perhaps be more of a negative factor, the story and characters manage to overcome this issue for the most part. The premiere is a very solid return to \"Game of Thrones\" and it does exactly what it needed to do: keep viewers in anticipation.",

The acting is outstanding, as it always has been, but with many plot twists, it makes it very interesting. Sansa's storyline looks like it will finally give her something that does not involve a psychopath, Tyrion is getting to know his city, the Mother of Dragons is held captive, and the Nights Watch defend Jon's body. Arya is getting used to being blind, Cersei and Jamie mourn their dead daughter, and trouble erupts in Dorne. It is a great beginning, while much is crammed into the short runtime of the episode, it does end on a great ending, something I was not expecting and does make a lot of sense the more you think about it.",

                    "content": "I have to be honest; I was scared going into this episode. Not because of any emotional connection to Jon Snow as a character or his story, but simply because the show's last season was so bumpy that my faith as a viewer slipped a bit. I was scared that the show would resurrect Jon in this opening episode, ruining any kind of narrative direction that it could have earned otherwise. Thank the Gods, then, that by the end of \"The Red Woman\" Jon Snow is still very much dead. His death shook each and every viewer invested in the show, but for that impact to carry through into the new season we needed to understand how his death affects the people of Westeros as well, and that's exactly what this episode does. We see a broken Edd, devastated by the loss of a true friend. We have Ser Davos, a man whose new found loyalty has been shaken and whose purpose in the narrative is now at question again. Finally, we have Melisandre; the Red Woman herself. Jon's death hits her the hardest. Melisandre has had every ounce of her faith stripped from her over this episode and the season five finale, and \"The Red Woman\" allows us to truly see the impact this has on her. As she retreats to her chamber, she strips naked, removes her necklace, and we see the real her for the first time: a withered, ancient woman. It's a starkly beautiful sequence, as harrowing as it is surprising. Carice van Houten - one of my favourite performers on the show - gives arguably her best performance to date here. She is portrays this fragility masterfully.The Wall was home to a variety of excellent sequences in this premiere, but the majority of the other subplots fared equally well. Arya's brief check-in served its purpose of updating us as to where she is now, and finished with the promise of a similarly violent sequence next week. Cersei's gutting reaction to finding Myrcella was a highlight of the episode; I've always adored Lena Headey as a performer, but she truly excelled here. Watching her walk towards the docks to greet her daughter only to cut away to her in her chambers later in the day was heartbreaking, which is quite an accomplishment given some of the monstrous acts that Cersei has performed. I also really enjoyed our check in with Dorne this episode, which surprised me greatly due to how dull and lifeless the Dorne arc was last year. This time around, though, it was benefited by a rapid change in pace. Watching Ellaria Sand murder Prince Doran was undeniably shocking, but it also worked in really emphasising how much Ellaria believes in her cause. She is willing to commit treason to gain revenge for what happened to Oberyn two seasons ago, and I felt that I understood her purpose in the show more in that one sequence than her entire arc last year.Our brief time with Daenerys was also solid tonight. It's unusual seeing Dany in a vulnerable position after her consistent development into power over the last few years, but it works due to Emilia Clarke's committed performance and the inclination that she won't be in this position for very long. With two large dragons in captivity, and an even bigger one nesting nearby, it's hard to imagine the new Dothraki horde staying in control here: it will just be interesting to watch Dany work her way out of this. Some of the humour felt slightly forced in this story, and not a lot of it landed, but I can overlook a small quibble in an otherwise strong subplot. Brienne, Podrick, Sansa and Theon all also came together tonight in a thrilling sequence placed surprisingly early in the episode. This grouping of characters was easy to predict, but I have to admit to being surprised by how quickly this came about. I didn't expect Brienne to pledge herself to Sansa again until at least the midpoint of the season, so this quick pacing helped push along the episode in its earlier half.Pacing was a general strength of this entire episode, really. Most Game of Thrones premieres attempt little more than a catch up of the last season's bloodbath, but here \"The Red Woman\" was content to cover a lot more ground. Perhaps it is down to this pacing increase, then, that it feels as if the show is beginning its end game. A handful of characters are now in places that could launch them into their resolutions, and for the first time in the show's history it feels as if we're a long way into this long, long story. Game of Thrones benefited last year from a tighter hold on character thematics, and it seems likely that that will be kept this year too: every character, here, is focused on a situation they've found themselves in whilst working towards something else. It gives each sequence a sense of purpose in the long run, as if every character isn't really that far apart despite the fact that they're on different continents. If this strong thematic purpose can be coupled with some powerful narrative development and a handful of climactic sequences, then we could be in for a hell of year.",

Season premieres are not meant to thrust you into the action of Hardhome or the heartbreak of the Red Wedding: they are meant to reintroduce you to the world of Westeros.And that is exactly what this episode achieved.Honestly, I was really impressed with this episode. We got to see almost all of the major characters, despite the relatively short run-time in comparison with other episodes.Sansa and Brienne have finally been brought together. It seems as though Sansa's come to her senses at last and realised that when a killing-machine like Brienne swears her allegiance to you, you don't say no. This is Game of Thrones. You win or you die, and Sansa's come pretty close to dying too many times already.Is there anything more satisfying than listening in on a conversation between two of the most intellectual and witty characters in Essos? Tyrion and Varys were brilliant together - as you'd imagine - and I can't wait to see how the two of them handle Meereen after the events of last season in the Daznak pit.I was completely caught off guard by Doran and Trystane being murdered. I don't think anybody quite expected that in the season premiere. This goes to show that Dan and Dave heard our criticisms last year of the Sandsnakes and Dorne, and have immediately gone straight for the jugular. The Sandsnakes are actually proving to be a threat and aren't giving stripteases in jail cells any longer.Cersei is going to kick ass this season. She's realised that the witch's prophecy is being fulfilled and in order to try to counteract it becoming a total reality she's going to become more protective over Tommen, her last surviving child, than a bear over her cubs.We got a brief introduction to Arya and witnessed how she's struggling with her latest problem. Last season Arya was in training, but left the training room too soon and was punished by the Many-Faced-God for it. Hopefully she'll be able to quickly learn from her mistakes and pick herself back up again soon.For a Khal, Khal Moro seems relatively respectful. I was half expecting him to behead Daenerys on the spot as soon as she hissed at him, yet he's clearly not like the other Khals.As you can see, this episode was quite impressive in the characters that it covered, but we are still yet to see Littlefinger, Bran, Sam, and some other new faces.I'd really like to see the trials of Margaery and Loras get underway soon, or at least let them be free by the Mother's Mercy as Cersei has been. Hearing that big oaf of a Septa saying \"confess\" incessantly is becoming rather tiresome. Also, please don't forget how action-packed the season five finale was. That episode was so dense that this episode was necessary to tie up what happened last season.Were some people expecting to see Jon jump up from the table or something? If you were paying attention in last season's finale, you'd have noticed how sullen and defeated Melisandre looked. Why? Because everything she thought she saw she didn't. She was so confident in herself - in her visions - and she was wrong. She is in turmoil, and it's going to take some incredible motivation to convince her that Jon is their only hope for survival. Just look at the final scene of the episode: she stripped away all of her clothing and magic and revealed her true self, which is something she's never done before and she'd only do if she felt utterly hopeless. Once she's found herself and she's committed to serving the Lord of Light again, then we can hope to see something happen with Jon.All in all, I'm thrilled with how this episode turned out. It did exactly what a season premiere aims to achieve, and more.",

Sansa and Theon's sequence was satisfying, but that's about all the good I can take from this episode. Oh yeah, the Dorne scene was also cool but did anyone really care about that storyline anyway? It definitely feels like the things we got excited to see in the trailer are all things that are going to happen in episodes 2-5. Like the minimum length for reviews on here is ten lines, and I don't even have that much to talk about so this whole sentence is mainly just filler so I can actually make it to ten.",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Despite how my review summary sounds, actually still liked a lot but didn't love the Season 6 opener \"The Red Woman\", though some fans did not. Am of the opinion also of finding \"Home\" the superior episode, it was what \"The Red Woman\" should have been and felt more like for me like the season opener. It is one of the most positively received Season 6 episodes and have seen it often considered one of the best latter season episodes, both distinctions for very good reason. Here in \"Home\", characterisation and plot lines are both advanced (loved seeing more of Bran, after being neglected for a while, Ramsay being suitably despicable and am still really appreciating seeing Theon in a completely different light to when he was first introduced. There are plenty of shocks and leaving-one-floored revelations, with like \"The Red Woman\" necessary questions and predictions left on fans' lips being answered and with full impact. A lot happens in \"Home\", but it doesn't feel like there is too much going on or that it feels rushed. It is tautly paced but also takes its time without ever being too much of a slow burner. As one would expect, the cast can't be faulted with Iwan Rheon and Isaac Hampstead Wright here being the standouts. Peter Dinklage as always steals every scene he's in.Visually, \"Home\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Home\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking with plenty of passion and sensitivity. Summing up, outstanding episode and one of Season 6's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The material in Winterfell is particularly violent and shocking but also inevitable and to a certain extent, satisfying when it comes to Roose Bolton's demise. An aged Bran is suddenly back with a twist: the show introduces a new kind of time-travel flashbacks which are somewhat unnecessary to the overriding storyline but still add a novel aspect to the proceedings. The shadowy dragons look the best they ever have here, too.",

Of all the characters, these guys are the ones I would love to see incinerated. Of course, that means that we need to develop an affinity for one of the most evil characters in all of literature. She is lying in the weeds like a snake with her insipid son. We also get back to Arya and her quest. And what of John Snow? How will he manifest himself in the next episode. And what about those dragons? And Brann and his role. Theon gains humanity again which is all he could hope for. And then the quest for Sansa. Love this show.",

Then Jaime challenges the High Sparrow and finds how powerful he is. Tyrion decides to release two dragons that are not nourishing. Arya is being beaten again and is still blind. Ramsey learns that his father has a baby son and he takes a bloody attitude. Theon decides to leave Sansa that intends to go to Castle Black. The Greyjoys will have a heir in the Iron Islands. Davos makes an impossible request to Melisandre, but the witch is powerful. \"Home\" is a good episode of \"Game of Thrones\", with surprises in Castle Black. Jaime discovers how powerful the High Sparrow is. Ramsey's segment is the most violent and shows how despicable this character is. Arya's segment is boring and it finally seems that her situation will change with the presence of The Faceless Man. The conclusion again is the best moment of the show. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): \"Home\"",

Further south the traitors of the Night's Watch move to kill Ser Davos and his men but just as they strike a Wildling force arrives from the south and the tables are turned. In Meereen Tyrion frees the two remaining dragons from their chains. Cersei is kept from seeing the body of her daughter while High Sparrow stands up to Jaime Lannister. In Winterfell Ramsay murders his father\u0085 and worse. On the Iron Islands the king is murdered.This episode got off to a fine start; I'd almost forgotten about Bran, he'd been out of the show for so long; his reintroduction was well handled and raised some interesting questions about Hodor and what happened to his aunt. The other highlights of the show were the events at Winterfell and on the Iron Islands; the death of Roose Bolton at the hands of his son was a shock but not half as disturbing as what Ramsay did to his step mother and new baby half-brother. With one leader dead I certainly didn't expect the death of Balon Greyjoy moments later. The show's finale should have been equally surprising but unfortunately it was impossible to avoid spoilers about Jon Snow's resurrection so it was just a question of which episode he would actually return in\u0085 even so the scene was well handled. While the other scenes weren't quite as dramatic as these I still found them interesting and at no point did I feel that anything we were shown was unneeded. Overall a quality episode that was definitely a step up from the season opening, which I also enjoyed. I'm definitely keen to see what happens next.",

                    "content": "Tonight's episode saw the fall of a few Kings and the return of everyone's favorite Lord Commander. I'm surprised it was this soon but wow what an episode. I don't think anyone at this point is doubting the fact that season 6 very well could be the best season to date. Two very good episodes to begin the season and it can only get better.Beginning with Bran, because it has been a minute. I think like many other fans, Bran has never been my favorite character. Similar to Arya, his story has always felt so far away from everything else that has been happening on the show, but with the Three-Eyed Raven, Bran very well may be the key to connecting everything. I love that we are getting flashbacks through him, including next week's Tower of Joy sequence.Cersei can't catch a break, which one of the reasons why if I were anyone in Kings Landing, I'd stay the hell away from her or her bodyguard, The Mountain. This week she wasn't even able to attend her daughter's funeral. I hate her guts for countless reasons but I couldn't help but feel bad for her. Fortunately, Tommen seems to be coming around and ended up visiting her with Jaime's advice. Jaime had a great scene with the High Sparrow who is seemingly threatening him the same way he did to Cersei last year. As far as Jaime has come, I don't know if his future is too bright.Speaking of feeling bad for someone, Theon was a part of what may have been my favorite scene of the episode. That would make it back to back weeks for Sansa as I really loved her embracing Theon. Another character who has gone through so much throughout this show, good and bad. For Sansa to embrace him, that was a big moment. So much so that I actually felt for Theon in that situation and I do believe that he \"doesn't want to be forgiven\" for all that he's done.Theon may be in for a surprise as his father died at the hands of Euron Greyjoy. Having not read the books, I'm not sure how Euron factors into the bigger picture, but I don't see good things happening to Theon when he returns. But Balon Greyjoy wasn't the only major death of the night.Roose Bolton finally paid the dues for his betrayal of the Starks. I kind of wish it was a little more brutal and painful, but Ramsay does his best. Then just when we thought Ramsay had done the absolute worst thing by raping Sansa, he goes and kills his step- mother and newborn baby brother. Yikes. If only someone didn't raise from the dead to keep the attention off of him.With no Daenerys in the episode, Tyrion filled the void by essentially unleashing the dragons from the cave. It wasn't entirely clear where they went, but I don't expect them to be in that cave for long. Arya also had a brief scene this week as she got beat up a little more by Waif before pleading to Jaqen that she is in fact \"no one\". Both great scenes, and both seem to set up the future very well.Lastly, of course is Castle Black. Talk about a surprise. I did not expect Jon Snow to be resurrected this early in the season but I couldn't be more happy. With Sansa heading to the Wall and Snow rising, Castle Black is the place to be. I loved seeing the Wildlings jump in and defend Snow from Thorne and the others. It was also great seeing Davos come to Melisandre for help and believe in what she can do instead of the opposite. I am beyond excited to see the Nights Watch take down Ramsay once and for all. Rise of the Starks here we come.+SNOW+Bran sees the past+Two huge deaths+Tyrion unleashes the dragons+Sansa and Theon embrace10/10",

However, this episode surprised me and since there's no problem I have, this is an improvement over The Red Woman.The story is a lot more compelling and advances the plot progression from the previous episodes perfectly. The performances are once again compelling with Lena Headey and Dean Charles Chapman sharing an emotional moment together. And that's not all. It finally revealed the fate of Jon Snow and left a shocking cliffhanger to what would really happen in the next episode.That being said, everything else turned out great. The pacing is tighter and never drags, the script is well-written, the directing is solid, Ramin Djawadi's music score shines and suits the emotional scenes and the atmospheric moments really well, and the editing is really good. So, overall, another classic episode for the entire show and an improvement over the first episode, which I thought was a good start. :)",

                    "content": "Whenever I watch this show, I turn in to a whimpering baby. Game of Thrones is, in terms of literature, the next Lord of The Rings. It's the epic complex fantasy series that gets scrutinized in all its wonderful detail by a massive community. And yet what makes Game of Thrones somewhat unique is that the adaptation is coming out while the story is still unfinished. Enough of the book version came out before the show that people were able to develop this deep fascination and speculation about the lore, but now the show is ahead of the books. As a result, being a book reader triples my investment in the show; these are the characters I have been analyzing and following for years; this is the result of their story, suddenly playing itself out in a weekly format where anything can happen. It's wonderful, terrifying, and exhilarating. True, it can also result in disappointment (such as last week's Dorne plot). But when an episode like this one, or last season's Hardhome comes along, viewing it is an experience like no other. Every scene leaves you hanging on a knife's edge. And with that in mind, let's begin.At the start of the episode, we (FINALLY) catch up with Bran. We see that he and the Three Eyed Raven are deep in vision. We then cut to that vision, where we see a young Ned and Benjen stark practising in the courtyard of Winterfell. The way it is shot is a replica of the scene in the pilot where young Bran practised in the same spot. This highlights the fact that Bran was simply following the path of every young Stark that came before him, adding an extra dimension to the pilot. And now, in the vision, Bran and the Three Eyed Raven stand where Ned and Catelyn stood in the pilot, underlining how far Bran has come. The scene sets up some things for the reveal of Jon Snow's parents, and introduces a young Hodor. We begin to see the tragic story of Hodor, making me feel bad for taking part in the internet's loving mocking of him. When we return to the cave, we see that the makeup artists have worked more on the Children's look, and Meera feels lonely.At Castle Black, the battle that was setup in the last episode plays itself out. The result was satisfying but slightly confusing; how did Davos and the others contact the Wildlings?Roose Bolton's child is born, and Ramsay does something unexpected. I mean truly unexpected. I expected it to happen eventually, but not now. It is actually pretty satisfying, until he gets to the second part of his plan. That's when it becomes so brutal that I had trouble watching. I really hope he dies this season.Theon departs. It's kind of sad, kind of cathartic. Where is he going?We get a scene with the common folk in King's Landing. It is legitimately good to catch up with them; I always like seeing the underbelly of the big events in the plot. It also leads to a Franken-Mountain moment that makes one unsure whether to laugh, wince, or cry. I settled for a wince. Myrcella's funeral happens (is it technically even a funeral if there is no ceremony and only two people show up?). Jaime and the High Sparrow have a stare down. Tommen has a touching scene.Ary- I mean... no-one deals with more abuse. Tyrion drinks and knows things. Then he uses those things he knows to perform one of the best and most nerve-wracking Tyrion scenes ever.For the first time in forever, we visit the Iron Islands, and a book moment we've been waiting for for a long time finally comes. I have a feeling that after the way they've screwed up Dorne, they are making sure to take their time and get the Greyjoy plot just right. Well, so far they've succeeded. What a fantastic way to introduce a new character. And the famous Kingsmoot scene can be seen on the horizon.I imagine that the final scene will melt the internet. It's a moment that many people have been waiting for for 5 years (since the last book came out). There's been so much speculation about this for so long that it doesn't even feel real to me now that it has finally happened. Dan and David really had a fun time stretching it out, as well. They really milked that scene for all it had. As I watched it, thought to myself \"at this point, if nothing happens, the director is basically Hitler\". After the sheer disappointment around that Walking Dead finale, the scene almost managed to convince me that nothing was really going to happen. But then, at long last, we viewers were put out of our misery. What an episode. The semi-ex-positional nature of last episode had some thinking that this season would once again fall victim to the flaws of last season, but this is the episode that proves them wrong. This is, in a nutshell, one of the greatest episodes of Game of Thrones, and a fantastic way to get the season rolling.",

                    "content": "WARNING! *MAJOR* SPOILERS AHEAD, AND I MEAN IT!After a disappointing Season 5, the second episode of Season 6 makes up for it with several climactic moments squeezed in within an hour. In addition to the long-expected ending (which most fans were very happy to see, I'm certain), there were other important shifts in power, most importantly in the Iron Islands and the North. I was glad to see the Iron Islands again, after a lengthy absence, and was also pleased to see the farewell of one of my favorite \"Game of Thrones\" villains, the hunched, Riff-Raff-looking Lord Reaper of Pyke, Balon Greyjoy. At least the old king went down fighting. I'm excited to see what role the Ironborn will play in the wars to come...hopefully they will play a *major* role.Ah, yes, and the plot turns as Ramsay Bolton (nee Snow) takes control of Winterfell. To those who think his actions mark a new low....there's never low enough for Ramsay. When it comes between power and family, he will take power, hands down. In essence, his character and actions are downright Shakespearean: he reminds me of Edmund from King Lear, Macbeth, and Richard III; although, unlike the calculating Duke of Gloucester, Ramsay is willing to get his hands dirty every time. He is most like \"Lear's\" Edmund---and, to a lesser extent, the legitimate, though shunned Richard III--- in that he is an illegitimate son who feels cut from power, and will do what he can to get what he feels is rightfully his. I will admit that Roose Bolton's departure was shocking; but I suppose, based on his actions at the Red Wedding, it was fitting end for him. Murdering his half-brother and stepmother ruthlessly, while disturbing, was not surprising. It will be interesting to see where his ruthless quest for power will lead him. Hopefully, Ramsay will suffer a fate far worse than any of his Shakespearean counterparts.Ah, yes, then we go full circle with the imprisonment Dany's dragons. The whole reason they were imprisoned was because they wantonly caused destruction. How will Tyrion hope to control them? Tyron is a great thinker and leader, so I hope that he has a plan for setting free the dragons. I look forward to Season 6 resolving this matter; though, after Season 5's dismal performance, I won't give my hopes up. I love Tyrion for his skills as a leader, and freeing the dragons seems to be yet another example of his cunning. Let's hope my surmising in this instance was right, and that he didn't make the biggest mistake in his life by doing so.In short, the climactic moments and brisk pace of this episode made it far more satisfying than any of previous seasons. I'd argue that this episode was the best since Season 1. I hope it's not a fluke, and that most of Season 6 is as disappointing as Season 5. Still, I hold out hope that \"Home\" portends a highly entertaining season ahead of us.",

                    "content": "This episode brought us 2 major things that I had been looking forward to for this season. This episode started with seeing Bran for the first time in over season. I really loved the flashback they used to display the power of the 3 Eyed Raven. It was pretty cool to see little Ned in his training and learning to become the warrior we heard so much about. I was also awesome seeing little \"not so little\" Hoodor. Who knew Hoodor had a name, Willis. And more importantly, who knew he could at one point talk.I thought the scenes at King's Landing where pretty good. While it didn't do too much, I though that through these scenes we really got to see Tommen in his leader mindset and talking to Jamie about his self doubt of his ruling abilities. I like how it's a massive contrast between the way Joffery ruled with such dominance and Tommen's passiveness as a leader. My favourite moment of the scenes in King's Landing was the head slam by the mountain. It was the typical brutality of GOT and slightly comedic.In this episode, Ramsey has officially become one of the most evillest characters I have ever seen. Not only did he pass Kylo Ren in the murdering scale, he got a dog to eat his little brother. That is just messed up. By far, Ramsey is going to be the Joffery of the season, I can just see it now.What I really liked about what this episode did was transition between each location. Following on from the Boulton scenes we caught up with Sansa and Brienne. Not much happened in this scene which I don't mind because they are still trying establish this story line. I wasn't really expecting Theon to leave Sansa. I thought that their reconnection was a long time coming that it was really unexpected that it would be over just like that.Again they had a nice transition into the Greyjoy story line. Yet again not much happened in this sequence except the death of Lord Greyjoy. That was the second major death of a Lord in this episode alone. That is 3 for the season. With these actions I'm starting to think that we are getting into a theme of the falling of power. Already at the end of last season we saw the fall of Tywin, Stannis and Jon Snow (which I will talk about later), and already this season, 3 more major leaders have fallen. I wouldn't be surprised if by the end of this season, the make up of the show and the leadership of each family has changed dramatically.Again I liked the Arya scenes this episode. They are really setting her up as some who is embracing the fate and accepting her role as a faceless assassin. I like how they ended her scenes really open ended with us wondering where she was being taken by the faceless assassin himself.My favourite part of this episode was Tyrion. First of all we got to see the line that had us all cracking up in the trailer about him drinking and knowing stuff. I thought his scenes with that dragons were fantastic. I like how he told the story while he freed the dragons and how the dragons responded. It was a massive character development for Tyrion as we got a bigger in site into his life growing up under Tywin. I loved his end line to Vary when he left the cave. Tyrion is the comedic relief to this show and his scenes are always fantastic.Now finally, Jon Snow. From the start we always thought that The Red Woman would have a really big part in the return of Jon Snow, and from what we can see, I think she did. Obviously there are still many questions into how he came back. I like how they pointed a lot of action towards Ghost the wolf. What I took out of it with how it was edited that Ghost awoke the same time Jon did, was that Jon had transferred into the body of Ghost after his death. Therefore the awakening of Ghost was the indication that Ghost is back in control of his body and the awakening of Jon showed that he has indeed returned.Overall this was a really nice episode all round. Apart from the ending with the reawakening of Jon Snow and a couple of powerful deaths, this episode continued to set up the world of season 6 and build off what the first episode had started.9/10",

But though I try to write a fair review, they keep feeding me reasons to shake my head in disbelief.This episode was not bad - I could have given it a 7, but I think it's already getting unjustifiably good ratings and I won't help. Let's see: there are some good parts in it. The Greyjoys for one. We get Balon's death and the Kingsmoot. Of course one has to wonder why it took them so many years to include it. But still. Bran's part was good too. The inclusion of young Hodor was nice, though I didn't much care for the fact he could once talk. Also, the three-eyed raven is a huge and unnecessary letdown in terms of appearance at least. Make no mistake. The faults are with the story exclusively and not how it is told. It is still a damn well made show. But without the golden egg goose. Jaime keeps taking steps back in character development. Davos hasn't even asked Melissandre about Stannis but suddenly and for no reason decides he is a huge fan of Jon Snow and asks her to resurrect him. Just like that. Which everyone knew would happen but we are still tormented with a \"oh, it didn't work :( *everyone leaves the room* OH LOOK, IT WORKED AFTER ALL\" scene that belongs in the trashcan of clich\u00e9s.And of course, we have Ramsay killing his father. The scenes are well played, the subsequent slaughter of the innocents is a powerful addition, but the whole thing, once again, makes no sense at all. Not in Westeros. Not anywhere but the realm of typical TV shows, and GoT used to not be one of those. Why would the Karstarks, or any house of the North, ever consider, for a split second, to aid Ramsay in killing his father. Their collective goals would remain the same, except instead of dealing with the cold, ruthless, but ultimately reliable Roose Bolton, you'd have an unpredictable psychopath presiding over you. The fact is, you wouldn't do that. Not in a song of ice and fire, where decisions make sense. And when they don't, they get punished. But not here. Not anymore. Not for Benioff and Weiss who don't really understand what they are doing and are just, in sad, sad fashion, keeping the most popular / most hated / prettiest characters at any cost of logic and story, all the while getting rid of anyone who might confuse the naive audience they think they are addressing.",

There is no point in watching this tripe, none whatsoever, it will kill the book experience completely and in a few years nobody will care about a show of the off week.

Hodor of giants blood was quite dimwitted he wasn't Lemmy who ate all the pies. The Greenseer cave had a tree line in the show when Jojen died, when the were running away from the Wights the last time we saw it. Did the Whitewalkers fell that forest? Bran didn't look like Bran, its voice was broken and had gained about 20 pounds with shorter hair. Off to the Red keep for total nonsense and its pointless scene. Why is that abomination not in the Red Keep when Cersei is under house arrest and she cannot leave the keep. No trial by combat, she has a pet that does its own thing, Tommen who has hit puberty. No guess work there, sparrows do what sparrows do even though there was Keep full of Kingsgaurd. Tyrion the dragon tamer has never seen Viserion and Rheagal, the dragons who have eaten slavers, they had even eaten a little boy previously. They aren't puppies, disgusting. The Dragons were like the main reason for watching this show, not anymore. Recycle the Red Wedding seriously, where are his bodyguards where, Bastards are so obvious. But the Freys have disappeared, ridiculously. The Wildlings will crush the Boltons and the Wall will tumble, retreat to the Eyrie and careless. Now to the Kingsmoot with somebody who doesn't even resemble the kings brother just some fatso with a different accent. The king was supposed to be dead from blood magic, maybe Stannis didn't use that leech on the false king, because he sent Yara knob shopping. No guess there. Dany needs some ships, so we has ships, even though those idiots have done nothing else this entire time. The freaking Blood magic ritual needed Davos expert guidance and the ritual was burn hair then pour water on hair, dominos sante some Latin gibberish exorcism and presto oops wait for it, whistle at Ghost, that does it. Reek and Sansa blah blah blah he is walking and running with a spring in his step, maybe he will get to the kingsmoot by himself although we don't care what happened to Gendry. The Wildlings have stormed the keep and they are even holding talks with Melisandre and Davos hated by them when they had killed their King. Arya was a better scene only just about, hopefully she will take out the contract on Dany.This ship is stunk, no point in wrecking perfectly great books about.",

                    "content": "I could not fault this episode if I tried to.Dan & Dave clearly aren't waiting around with all of their story lines. They've got a lot to cover and after last season's somewhat underwhelming aftertaste, they're evidently eager to prove they've got what it takes - especially now that we're ahead of the books. Bran is back (and walking!), and he's much more advanced with his powers than when we last left him. We were treated this episode to seeing a younger Ned, Lyanna, Benjen, and Hodor. As one of the Children said, he won't be there forever, so I'm excited to see where Bran heads off to later this season.Tommen, Jaime and Cersei are going to be the fiercest family in Westeros this season. Tommen is even asking for his mother's help. Oh, sweet summer child, if only he knew what he was asking for. Did anyone else flinch when the Mountain (Cersei's colossal knight in shining armour) smashed that commoner's skull against the wall? I thought back to Oberyn's unfortunate encounter with him and immediately shuddered. He's going to be problematic for the Faith; it's only a matter of time.Tyrion and dragons. Holy sh*t. Hilarious and exciting: \"I'm friends with your mother...\" He probably knows more about them than Daenerys! I was so worried that Tyrion would announce he intends to free the dragons from captivity but then we'd have to wait a few episodes until that actually happened. I was delighted to see him descending those steps in this episode and chatting with Viserion and Rhaegal as if he'd known them for years. Ramsay isn't waiting around either. As soon as Walda gave birth to a baby boy, Ramsay knew he had to make a move. I just wasn't expecting him to move so quickly! Now that he's Lord Bolton, Warden of the North, I'm so looking forward to him meeting Jon.The Greyjoys are back, and it's time for a new face. Euron Greyjoy has firmly shoved his older, much more unpleasant brother out of his way, and will likely try to compete with Yara for the throne of the Iron Islands.Arya also - thank goodness - is learning quickly, and has already made progress. The Faceless Man is escorting her back to the House of Black and White, where she'll continue her training. Arya is yet another character which is going to kick ass this season, and she's still got some more names to cross off of that list of hers.Something many feared would occur was that Jon wouldn't return until around halfway through the season and we'd be eagerly awaiting that episode with everything preceding it being sub-par. Well, this goes to show that Dan & Dave aren't waiting about: he's back! I can't wait to see everyone at Castle Black's reactions when they find out he's alive again - especially Ser Alliser and Olly. Melisandre is going to have a field day when she finds out she wasn't wrong after all.This episode has left me with nothing but confidence for the rest of this season; it will live up to and excel beyond the brilliance of season four.We're in for the best season of Game of Thrones yet.",

There just isn't an easier way for it than getting as many people killed off the show as possible. Another thing I've been wondering is whether the show's screenplay is written by the same folk who write for: 1) The Bold & The Beautiful 2) Adult entertainment, i.e. porn.First of all, the children in the show apparently grow up instantly like the children do in the soap operas. Several years for each year of the time that lapses in the world. Recently the dialogue and suspense in the show is on par with the level of porn movies. There are constant remarks in the dialogue about sex and genitals. Many of these lines are put in the mouths of people who have not behaved in such manner earlier in the show. Other bits are completely pointless and add nothing to the show. Our family now counts how many times the f-word and other profanities are said aloud in each episode. The dialogue in the show used to be witty and interesting. Now much of the dialogue is just stupid and boring.Then there is the thing about people appearing from out of nowhere just in the nick of time for the rescue. Resulting in the \"how convenient\" - experience... Sort of reminds me of how hot nurses/whatever appear from out of nowhere when a porn star is in dire need of some help with his sexual urges. Sigh. On top of that, the end of this episode, the \"cliffhanger\" was a tad bit clich\u00e9 and predictable from the start of the season. Fortunately, there were a couple of good scenes that added value to the story and character development (Hodor as a child), but much of this episode was slightly disappointing.",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.It is always a Herculean task following on from such greatness seen previously. \"Oathbreaker\" had a tough task succeeding, and being just as good as, the previous episode \"Home\" considering how superb that episode was (one of the best Season 6 and latter season episodes). A tough task that it almost succeeds completely in, it's not quite perfect and it's not as special but it has a vast majority of what makes 'Game of Thrones' so great and signs that one shouldn't give up on the show. Tommen needs to develop a stronger personality and have more meat to his material before being considered as a love to hate character for me. Actually though there is hardly anything wrong with \"Oathbreaker\". It doesn't matter that it is not as action-packed as the previous two episodes (compared to \"The Red Woman\" actually that's a good thing), while not quite being a slow or quiet episode either. It also doesn't matter that it doesn't have as many reveals, shocks or cliff-hangers as \"Home\".What \"Oathbreaker\" does brilliantly in is putting things in place for what is to follow, without feeling like filler, forwarding story momentum and advancing character development and interplay. Daenerys and Arya are particularly well done in this regard and it was wonderful to see some development to Khaleesi. The highlight of the episode though is the Tower of Joy, totally exhilarating. Have nothing to fault the cast, who give uniformly never less than great performances. Iwan Rheon plays a true slimeball to perfection, now Ramsay is my definition of a love to hate character.Visually, \"Oathbreaker\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Oathbreaker\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.The writing is thought-provoking and very rich in layers with plenty of passion and sensitivity. Summing up, terrific. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

The reason with this is that it's a dialogue-heavy episode that just goes on and on and on with long-winded conversations that even worse don't add anything to the narrative or move the plot on in any way; they're just there for character. At least the Arya chat is accompanied by training scenes, whereas the High Sparrow scene is completely pointless and just goes over things we already know. The Sam and Gilly scene in the ship is also pointless, and for the \"comedy\" with Tyrion - why?! The only thing that makes this episode partway good is the stuff in the North; the Ramsey and Jon scenes are great, and the flashback offers the best sword fight of the entire season.",

But those sparrows are so despicable. They represent a contrived religion that calls to mind the Spanish Inquisition. They are smug and dangerous and don't seem to practice much of what they preach. I'm really looking forward to this ineluctable collision. I still don't quite know what Arya's endgame is. I think I lost it in some of the deluge of events. Where is that dragon? Dany is playing a bit of a waiting game. There are so many characters who are soon to be rising from the ashes. John Snow has literally done so. This episode, while lacking bombast, is laying a foundation of incredible explosiveness. Ramsay Bolton continues to lay down his slime trail. One wants so badly to wipe the disgusting grin off his face. He has been \"forced\" into patricide and infanticide, but the powers that be know what he is. What a magnificent villain he is! Anyway, it's going to be great fun watching things unfold.",

In Braavos, Arya continues her painful training. Umber meets Ramsay and delivers Osha and Rickon Stark to him to celebrate their union. Jon Snow executes his enemies and takes a surprising decision.\"Oathbreaker\" is an uneven episode of \"Game of Thrones\". The resurrection of Jon Snow, his attitude hanging his enemies and his decision in the end of the episode are the best moments of this show. Ramsay with Rickon Stark is also promising. The other segments are only reasonable and Arya's journey in Braavos is annoying. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Oathbreaker\"",

                    "content": "This episode opens where the last ended; with Jon Snow waking from the dead. He is understandably confused while Melisandre is keen to know what he remembers of the time between dying and returning to life. Later those who killed him are punished and he decides his future is not in the Watch. Meanwhile the Three-Eyed Raven is showing Bran more of his family's past; including things that contradict what he thought he knew about his father. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys is taken to be with the other Khal's widows; Arya progresses in her training and in Meereen Varys learns who is behind the Sons of the Harpy. Back in King's Landing Tommen converses with High Sparrow and in Winterfell Rickon Stark, along with Osha, is given to Ramsay Bolton. We also see Sam and Gilly for the first time this season as they sail south through rough seas.This was another impressive episode. I was pleased that it immediately dealt with Jon's return to life and asked whether there was divine reason, as Melisandre believes, or whether it has no greater meaning. It was interesting to see a flashback to Ned Stark's early life and learn that he hadn't exactly been honest about some of his exploits; I hope we learn more later, especially about what happened to his sister. After all the talk about Lord Varys's 'little birds' it was interesting to learn just who they were and to see that they are now working for Qyburn. It was also nice to see Arya's training progress a bit; it was getting a bit depressing seeing this strong-willed character getting beaten down every episode\u0085 even if it was necessary to make her give up her past. The scenes with Daenerys at Vaes Dothrak were interesting enough, even though not much happened they hinted at things to come. While this isn't the most action packed episode it does have its moments; most notably an impressive sword fight in Bran's vision but also during Arya's training, even if in the latter case we can guess that nobody is going to die. Finally it was great to see Rickon Stark again even if he is in a perilous position\u0085 to be honest I'd forgotten about him. Overall this was another solid episode.",

                    "content": "After two strong and packed episodes of Thrones, I found 'Oathbreaker' to be on the slower side, but still had plenty to chew on. Jon Snow is officially back. Cersei is about to do some serious damage to the faith. Arya got her sight back. Dany faced another setback. Ramsay received a gift. And we got a glimpse into the infamous Tower of Joy sequence. I really like that each of the first 3 episodes has started at Castle Black. Kit Harrington has teased that this is going to be the biggest Jon Snow season yet, and looks like he may be right. I was on the edge of my seat waiting for the first lines out of his mouth but I was pleasantly surprised at how long they kept him silent. Seeing Davos sitting in absolute awe of what just happened was equally as pleasing. But nothing was more satisfying than seeing his murderers hanged to death. Alliser and Olly needed to go.With that said, seeing Snow essentially end his watch was surprising. I can't say I actually believe he will leave Castle Black all together, especially with Sansa just around the corner. But having Jon leave just as Sansa arrives is the type of thing Thrones loves to do.We finally got a little bit of hints as to what truly happened at the legendary Tower of Joy sword battle between Arthur Dayne and Ned Stark. Seeing that this was shown through Bran, I knew it wasn't going to be a prolonged sequence but I expected to get to see the conclusion of the Rhaegar-Lyanna situation atop the tower. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be this week, hopefully next episode we get what we are all waiting for.Meanwhile, Dany had another setback as the Khals refuse to see her as the leader she is. Every other storyline seems to be picking up the pace, except for the Mother of Dragons. Assuming Drogon has had enough rest, he should be on his way sooner or later.Back at Kings Landing, Cersei is about to put a beating down on anyone who gets in her way. I loved seeing her and Jaime barge their way through the small council and make their demands. Surprisingly, I'm team Lannister if it means getting rid of the High Sparrow and the rest of the faith. Speaking of which, it was nice seeing Tommen make a move on the High Sparrow, only to see him succumb to his persuasive ways a few minutes later.Varys apparently located the leader of the Sons of the Harpy as Tyrion and the rest of the Meereen crew wait patiently amidst Dany's absence. It's unfortunate that Dinklage hasn't gotten a ton of screen time this season but the few scenes he does get are always wonderful. But I don't suspect we have seen the last of the Harpy, even with Varys' findings.Lastly, Ramsay was presented with a Stark boy, presumably as a bargaining tool for battle later and Arya got her sight back. I really dug the Arya scenes this week as she went through her entire history with Wiaf and Jaqen. I know everyone is expecting her to turn on the two of them and go after the remaining people on her list, but I'm not sold on that just yet. Ramsay on the other hand seems to be brewing up to take Castle Black, though perhaps, it could be the other way around. Maybe Jon Snow takes the battle to him once Sansa informs him of what he's up to? Overall, it wasn't the most shocking or action heavy episode, but it had more set up of what's to come. It was also a nice episode at showcasing the 'Oathbreaker' theme throughout several characters. Although, With 7 episodes to go, I hope the pace picks up a bit.+Snow is a god+Legendary sword battle+Arya gets her sight+Lannisters-Wanted more from the Tower of Joy-Tommen is a wuss 8.0/10",

I saw the preview of this last night and much like the previous episode, it surprised me. There aren't any problems I do have with it.The plot progression's very solid this time around and it continues to advance the story lines perfectly. Jon Snow, Arya, and Bran had so much to do. The same goes to Daenerys and Tyrion not to mention Ramsay Bolton planning on what to do with Rickon, one of the Stark family members. The script is superb and the performances continue to be compelling. Also, it has a nice set up to what's going to happen in the later episodes. If Jon Snow battles against Ramsay Bolton in the middle of this season, it would be really cool.The directing is smooth and well-focused, the editing is solid, the pacing is really good and never drags. The character relationships are still as interesting as they were in the previous seasons, the sets are still lavish along with the gorgeous scenery and Ramin Djawadi's music score continues to shine. So, overall, Oathbreaker is another excellent episode that lives up to the high standards left by Home. Thumbs up. :)",

                    "content": "I loved how they started with Jon Snow. It was only fitting that we picked up right from where we left off last episode. I really like how well Harington played this scene. We've really only seen a leader Snow and from what I can remember we haven't seen a large range of emotion from Jon Snow as a character. I thought Harington brought a large amount of emotion to his reawakening especially with him dealing with trying to come to terms with what has happened. I really liked how the following scene played out with everyone being so scared of Jon, and Tormund being the one to speak everyone else's minds.Catching up with Sam is always great. It's the first time this season we got to see him and I think they really gave a great introduction and reminder to what is happening with him and Gilly. I really hope that we get to see Sam back at Castle Black sooner rather than later because I really liked the relationship they have set up between Sam and Jon. There's a part of me however that is really interested to see where they are going to go with Gilly and Sam, I feel like we could see a big typical Game of Thrones twist involving them in some way.Again everything with the 3 Eyed Raven and Brann was great. I liked how they backed up from last week from showing child Ned and a more matured teen Ned this week. I really like how through Brann was are getting a form of prequel series to what happened before season 1. So far I've really loved these and I can only hope that they really continue this throughout the season. I really love Max von Sydow in these scenes. I think he really plays the power figure well really stands as a wise character.I'll admit, I'm not too sure on the direction they are taking with Daenerys. From the start of the series I was really invested in Daenerys and her drive towards the iron throne. But since the start of season 5, she's been a bit of a let down. While everything with the dragons and her time at Meereen wasn't in anyway boring, I just miss the drive she had earlier in the series. I hope they really recapture this aspect of her and get to see her back as a dominant force in the series.I really loved Varys in this episode. I like how he is no longer playing the side character and is becoming a leader in his own way. As the audience we really saw him pulling the strings and being a dominate character but its great to see him step up and take on a large role and dominate in it.Again, Tyrion was fantastic. Peter Dinklage continue to hit it out of the park. Full credit to the writers though. They have really turned the heat on Tyrion and he has so many memorably lines. He is really the comedic relief of this show and he plays this role fantastically. I loved how he had some wised words and when questioned who said it, he replied that it was him. Even though I've heard that singe joke heaps of times, it's the execution from Dinklage that allows him to nail it.I thought everything at Kings Landing was fantastic. I really like how they are playing with the Zombiefied Mountain. Everything from the reaction of the kids to the old guy, that I will never remember his name, farting himself. For me I really hope that we get to see The Mountain in action again this season. I know we are only a short way through but I'm just hoping that we get to see him play a massive role in the back part of the season.Tommen really got a big part this episode and I really liked it. While he is no Joffery and we don't love to hate him, I love he we are seeing him grow as a king. I thought he had a fantastic conversation with the High Sparrow. High Sparrow has been really great this season and has followed on from his big role at the back end of last season. Bit by bit I'm starting to really like him as a character.Arya's storyline stepped up this episode. I've always loved Ayra's storyline and I thought that it was always going to be interesting to see what happens with her blindness. I really loved the Daredevil style training montage we got this episode. They really represented her drive and determination which is a characteristic that made Arya one of my favourite characters.The reveal at the Bolton Castle was extremely unexpected but I loved it. We unfortunately got a bit of a spoiler from Maisie Williams that Rickon was going to return but I expected that to be towards the end of the season. I'm probably the same as everyone else in thinking that Rickon has grown up a hell of a lot. You really can see with the hair how he looks so much like Rob Stark. Hopefully the story with Rickon is played out well through the last bit of the season. There would be nothing worse than having both him and Osha reappear in the series for them to just be killed off.I thought the final scenes was a great way to end the episode. I wasn't really excepting to be a major death this episode, let alone 4 hangings. I liked how they came full circle this episode and ended back on Jon to get revenge on his death. Of course the big moment was Jon retiring from his Command. It now lays a great foundation to take Jon on a different path that we haven't seen him in a while since his time with the Wildlings.9/10",

The way the actors reacted to Jon's resurrection was as real as it was going to get.Without any spoilers, this episode is very slow paced when compared to the others. But there are many scenes, including the Tower of Joy scene, which is fantastic. We finally get to see a decent sword fight since season 4. However there are some plot twists that are much different than the book, which might annoy some book readers, and the gift presented to Ramsey, I wasn't too fond of. Unless it is going to hit Ramsey back in the head, I hope they don't kill the gift off, as we have not seen him in 3 years. It would be a waste.Other than that, this episode was brilliant, I can't wait to see the free Jon Snow kick some ass.",

With Davos and Jon both thinking WTF but not actually saying anything, Jon gets up realizing he was indeed dead. A lot It is said without words actually being spoken. Tower of joy. Much anticipated scene, I thought it was very well done especially Arthur Dayne, I thought he looked amazing with the sword. This was also interesting to see how things actually happened rather than the survivors interpretations of what happened. Unfortunately Max Von Sydow did blue ball us by taking Bran out of this vision before we could go into the tower. Hopefully we revisit this soon. Bran is not happy about getting taken out of the past to live in the present due to his happiness in the past and his dismal present and out looking future . Daenyrs joins other khal widows. We have not seen much of her this season through 3 episodes.. Lord Varys gets some information. Cersei states her intention to fight ser gregor as her champion against the faith. I am with Jaime, I cannot wait to see this trial by combat(CBGH) Pycelle lets loose after seeing ser gregor. The small counsel leaves Jaime and cersei. Tommen gets manipulated yet again. Very good scene with the high sparrow and tommen, tommen easily swayed after hearing something tywin once told him about listening to counsel so he takes this advice. Arya gets her sight back through it appears she is still drawn to her family, when she is praying to the olds gods of her family despite not knowing this while being blind. Rickon and Osha return and shaggy dog. I have watched this scene multiple times and I actually do not believe that was shaggy dog and I do not believe the Umbers are being straight with Ramsey. I don't know if it is just wishful thinking, but the wolf's head was small and Umber was throwing around a lot of insults and refused to swear any allegiance. We shall see. Jon gets justice against his murderers, we get justice with a long glimpse at #f*c*Olly. Jon states to everyone that because he has died, his watch has ended as he drops the mic and walks off stage.",

Let me start by listing a few grievances.What was the point in showing the Tower of Joy flashback if they were going to omit what made it important in the first place? I mean, That scene was absolutely irrelevant in showing if they weren't going to show it all the way through. I would go in depth about what was supposed to go down but only book readers know what I am talking about.Also, character motivations no longer make and sense whatsoever. Everyone who has a general understanding of the show understands that Umbers are fiercely loyal to the Starks. Yet when Rickon arrives to the Umbers, they take little Rickon, kill his wolf, and give him to Ramsey. YEAH, because that totally makes sense within the lore of the show.In addition to this, I read somewhere that Ramsey has become a Mary Sue type villain, and I have to agree with this statement. The thing that made Joffrey such a captivating villain was that he had limits, boundaries and actual motivations. Idiotic actions he committed actually had dire consequences. But nope, that's not the case with Ramsey! He is able to commit stupid decision after stupid decision and not receive any consequences whatsoever. NOPE! He is able to receive a new found ally and Rickon Stark! WOW! That makes sense in a universe where every action has consequences.I also am despising the amount of screen time they are devoting to Tommen. I mean, the best part about Tommen in the novels is that he is young and absolutely irrelevant to everything going on in Kings Landing. It is Cersei who the Kings Landing pplot was also focused on, but instead the show is trying to actually make us care about Tommen when he is absolutely irrelevant to the overall story.Also, Jon Snows resurrection has to be one of the most anti-climatic things in TV history after all of the hype. Usually the thing that made resurrection so interesting in the Game of Thrones universe was the fact that when someone gets resurected, they suffer dire consequences. When Beric would be continually revived by Thoros, he would forget things of his past, until he eventually forgot everything he was. Jon Snow is exactly the same. I mean, one could argue that all he cares about is vengeance seeing how he hanged the peple who killed him, but I don't see it this way. These people had to be murdered for killing their Lord Commander, not because Jon is changed and out for vengeance. Jon Snow is exactly the same with no character regression or anything.The only things they did somewhat right is daenerys storyline and the storyline in Meeren. However, the war that they are setting up in Meeren is something they shoud've already set up a season ago, and despite the fact that they are going this route now doesn't make up for all of the bs that occurred this episode.All in all, I am not excited with the direction this season is going anymore. This will most like be flagged down as not helpful by the Game of Thrones fanatics who praise each episode. Hey but if you read my review, I thank you for your time.",

                    "content": "This episode has the unfortunate position of following up last week's powerhouse episode, so anything this episode does should be quite underwhelming. Well, that isn't the case with this episode as it delivers on everything that makes Thrones so great: witty dialogue, bloody action, shocking turns of events and mysterious story lines.In terms of witty dialogue, there's a well-paced scene between Varys and the Harpy prostitute, preceding an excellent and down-right quotable scene between Tyrion and Missandei and Grey Worm, which is just Tyrion at his best. I really hope this season continues to give us these kinds of scenes with Tyrion as they were sorely lacking last season because of Tyrion's depressed and bleak attitude towards life, and they were also part of what made Season 2 so good. At the start of the episode, we get a surprisingly humorous exchange between Jon and Tormund & Edd, which is right after Jon is found out to be alive. This was really needed and worked really well as it provided some comic relief that kind of grounded the scene. Also, I don't think Jon should be seen as a godly character since a crucial part of his character is that he is the shameful bastard of Ned Stark, which really humanises his character.Speaking of Ned Stark, we get the awesome and bloody action that Game of Thrones is known for as we get an almost Star Wars-like sword fight between Ned & his men and a dual-wielding Arthur Dayne who takes on all of them like a boss. I was just in awe of how amazing this sequence was that I didn't mind (too much) that the flashback ended before Ned went into the tower. But don't get me wrong, that was INCREDIBLY frustrating! Damn Three-Eyed Raven is such a cock-block. Although I'm pretty certain I and nearly everyone else knows what he's going to find in that tower, I still can't wait. Looks like we'll have to wait until episode 5 to find out the truth, which is a good thing because I don't think the show was ready yet in this episode to show the R+L=J reveal to casual viewers. I think there's just a bit of groundwork to cover to properly set that up. I do wonder how non-book readers or people that just watch it casually and don't do any external research on the show will think of this flashback. Either way, for me, this scene was great and still left on a mysterious and intriguing note. That scream Ned heard from the tower gave me chills! And it definitely sounded like a woman giving birth... There is other good stuff such as Jaime and Cersei teaming up and Arya's training finally being concluded. I mean, did I just hear Pycelle fart when he saw the Mountain? I also like the Ramsay & Rickon scene, though I knew it was coming, I didn't expect them to kill off Shaggy Dog. The ending scene is definitely setting up some awesome future episodes with Jon Snow leaving the Night's Watch because he did technically die. Overrall, this episode is half payoff/conclusion to some story lines (e.g. the identity of the Harpy's masters, the Night's Watch traitors, Arya's training, Jon's time at the Watch) and half-setup for future episodes, which gets me excited for what's to come. However, this episode also delivers on many of the aspects that make Thrones great. The only thing that stops this episode from being a 10/10 is that there are no mind-blowing or overly shocking moments, but this episode definitely gets a 9/10 from me.",

This is kind of episode that takes the story forward, a typical Game of Thrones episode. We had excellent conversations, gripping action sequence and shocking deaths.It is nice to see the story starts off with Jon Snow, his reaction to the resurrection was captured perfectly. With Davos and Melisandrae beside him, it is time for retribution. Although we wont be getting the Battle of Winterfell any time soon. Ser Allister Throne's final words captures his character perfectly. Although I was looking for some kind of interaction between Olly and Jon Snow.The Tower of Joy fight sequence casts some shadow on the Honor of Ned Stark, making him look more human. The fight sequence could have been better though. It was no where close to the Mountain vs Oberyn Martell sequence in season 4. The writers will probably skip Bran's story line (Notice that both Bran and FlashBack are missing in the episode 4 preview) in the next episode so we have to wait 2 more weeks for R+L=J.It was good to see Sam again. He will have a bigger role to play once he learns from the books in the library.Many people believe that Dany's story arc has nose dived in Season 6. But I believe she is going to find something important at Vaes Dothrak that is going to define her future. And hopefully to find her way back to Westeros. Back at Mareen her story was going no where. I have always wondered how Varys works with his little birds. Now we know he uses children, mostly orphans for spying. It would be interesting whether his little birds in Kings Landing work as double agents now that they are under Qyburn who has taken charge of the post of Master of Whispers.Tommen is not a cruel king like his brother. He is not a mad king like Aerys II Targaryen. He is not an irresponsible king like Robert Baratheon. To sum up he is no kind of King. Just a puppet. Most likely his death is imminent. However his life is all that is holding back a full fledged civil war is Westeros.The best part of today's episode is Arya's progress to become a no-one. She is nearly there. The montage of her training was excellent. But just when you think the Starks are safe Rickon runs into Ramsey. The death of Shaggydog was shocking. We can safely say that there is no harm to Rickon's life. He is more like a bargaining chip for the future.+Jon is free from his oath+Arya gets her sight back +Death of Allister Throne and Olly+Character development for Khaleesi-The fight sequence at Tower of Joy could have been better.-Two more weeks till R+L=J. Overall a typical Game of Thrones episode 9/10",

This episode gave satisfaction to the audience in more ways than one, and some scenes will go down in GOT history.My personal favourite moments from the episode came from Bran and the Three-Eyed Raven. The Tower of Joy flashbacks gave us enough content to satisfy our expectations, whilst still leaving it with a strong element of mystery. It was fantastic to see Eddard Stark again, even if it wasn't Sean Bean playing him this time; we forget how attached we all were to Ned in season one, and it is rewarding and special to see the character again after so many years. Bran's story is really becoming interesting, he was never that interesting in my own opinion, I didn't feel any major attachment to him compared to the likes of Arya and Robb. Season Six has already had a fair few comedic moments, and this episode was no exception. The scenes in Meereen involving Tyrion and Grey Worm were hilarious. Daenerys' storyline is a bit slower compared to the others but it was good to see her again after her absence last week. I hope we see Drogon soon! It was also fantastic to see Sam and Gilly again, as well as Osha and Rickon.The episodes closing act saw the deaths we have all been craving for so long; Olly and Alliser Thorne finally got the punishment they got for stabbing Jon. I must say that Owen Teale (Thorne) is a fantastic performer, and it will actually be sad not to have him feature on the show anymore, but then again, f**k Ser Alliser, and double f**k Olly, they deserved exactly what they got.Overall 'Oathbreaker' is not disappointing in the slightest, and it really delivered with its fan service; 8/10. Performance of the week: Max von Sydow (Three-Eyed Raven)",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Book of the Stranger\" is one of the best episodes of Season 6, which settled much quicker and more consistently than Season 5 generally, and a standout of the latter seasons, an episode that has everything that makes 'Game of Thrones' as great as it is and what it's all about. It is one of the most acclaimed episodes of the season, have also seen fans and critics cite it as one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes, and can totally see why on all counts. Never thought that another Season 6 episode could outdo the brilliant \"Home\", \"Book of the Stranger\" may have just managed that.While the whole story is tremendously absorbing with a lot of passion, sensitivity and emotional wallop, every 'Game of Thrones' episode has at least one standout scene even the weaker ones. \"Book of the Stranger\" has three, the Jon and Sansa reunion, Daenerys' conquering and the scene between Brienne, Davos and Melisandre. All three among the season's best scenes. Anything with Tyrion is awesome and also found the letter scene pretty harrowing with it showing how much a monster Ramsay is. The whole episode is packed with reunions, alliances and forward momentum in both story and characterisation, with plenty of surprises and emotion.'Game of Thrones' has always been consistent in the high quality of the acting. Particularly outstanding performances being from Emilia Clarke and Peter Dinklage.Visually, \"Book of the Stranger\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Book of the Stranger\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. The writing is thought-provoking and very rich in layers with plenty of passion and sensitivity. In conclusion, fantastic episode and a must watch. And this is coming from a genuine viewer who has not given every episode a 10 (have actually given my fair share of 8s and 9s) and has been honest in her opinions. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

Still, there's a lot of good stuff too, from Tyrion trying his hand at negotiation to the long-awaited reunion between Jon and Sansa. The scene with Ramsey is a small but vicious reminder of his character and helps lead us towards the end of this season nicely. The Daenerys storyline feels a little rushed here but that climax is nice fightback against the patriarchy.",

Jon Snow receives a letter from Ramsey with insults and threatening him. Daenerys is brought to the khals in a temple and the set in motion her evil plan. \"Book of the Stranger\" is among the best episode of \"Game of Thrones\". Every segment is excellent and important, but the reunion of Sansa and Jon Snow and the final scene of Daenerys and the khals are spectacular. The encounter of Brienne with Davos and Melisandre is tense. Soon the viewers will certainly see the bloody war that is coming. The powerful music score in the end is another great attraction of this great show. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Book of the Stranger\"",

                    "content": "As this episode opens Jon Snow is planning to leave Castle Black but before he does there is a surprise arrival; Sansa, along with Brienne of Tarth and Pod, comes through the gates and after a reunion with her brother tells him that he must prepare to lead an army to retake Winterfell from Ramsay Bolton; he initially less than keen but when, later in the episode, he receives a letter from Ramsay stating that he now has Rickon and demands Sansa's return he agrees that he must march south on Winterfell with a Wildling army. Back in King's Landing Queen Margaery talks to High Sparrow before being allowed to see her brother again. Elsewhere in the capital Cersei persuades Olenna Tyrell that her forces should move to King's Landing to free her children and destroy High Sparrow and his acolytes. A third family reunion takes place in Pike; here Theon is reunited with his sister and promises to serve her. Across the Narrow Sea Tyrion makes a deal with the slavers and Jorah and Daario sneak into Vaes Dothrak hoping to free Daenerys; she has a far more radical plan though.This was a top notch episode; it opened brilliantly; I was sure Sansa's travel north would be dragged out for quite a while longer but no. Her speech to her half-brother showed just how much this character has developed over the series; Sophie Turner was really good in the role. It continues well with plenty of hints at battles to come; Jon's to retake Winterfell; another to bring down the High Sparrow and possibly Yara Greyjoy struggle to become the ruler of the Iron Islands. We also get the welcome return of Lord Petyr Baelish for the first time this season; as manipulative and ambiguous as ever. All of this serves as a mere appetiser to the episodes fiery conclusion where Daenerys confronts the assembles Khals and destroys them in her own inimitable style; possibly this season's best moment so far\u0085 certainly its most spectacular. On a more downbeat note the episode sees the death of a secondary character who has been around since the first season\u0085 at least she got to die in an impressive scene as she tried, unsuccessfully, to kill Ramsey Bolton. Overall I think this was this season's best episode to date.",

                    "content": "Season 6 is shaping up to be one of the best seasons of Game of Thrones yet, and we're only a mere 4 episodes in. 'Book of the Stranger' contained one of the most satisfying scenes of the entire series, saw the rebirth of Daenerys, and plenty of other tidbits for the fans to chew on. For as miserable of a show this has been, it seems that good things are finally happening for the characters we have come to love for so many years, and I couldn't be more pleased with what I'm seeing.Beginning in Castle Black, as we have for all 4 of the episodes so far, Sansa finally reached The Wall. I was relieved her and Jon didn't coincidentally 'not' cross paths, as Jon wanted to leave. Their reunion was probably my favorite moment of the entire season and one of the most heartwarming scenes this show has had to offer (of the few that they've had). We've all been waiting for Sansa to take that big leap forward after all she's been through, and convincing Jon to go to Winterfell and take on the Bolton's was a much needed step. Speaking of which, it seems the warning letter from Ramsay involving Rickon's whereabouts was just the motivation Snow needed to make his next move. Unfortunately, that's exactly what Ramsay wants, and they are vastly outnumbered. How can Jon possibly get out of this one? Perhaps another shadow baby from Melisandre would help somehow? Not if Brienne has anything to say about it. Realistically, I'm sure Jon will get enough support from the houses of the North to take back Winterfell, I just hope it happens sooner rather than later. It also should be interesting to see just whose side Baelish is on. I'm not completely buying into him saying they will 'help' Sansa just yet.Similarly, the Lannisters are piecing together their next move against the High Sparrow and the faith. Seeing Cersei and Jaime be so assertive is nice when their son consistently does the opposite. Seriously, when is Tommen biting it? It's always nice to see Olenna Tyrell attempt to shut down Cersei, but in order to get Margaery back, they all need to work together. Anything to bring down the High Sparrow and his repetitive speeches would be welcomed. At the same time, I can definitely see all of the Tyrell's calling it quits this year. It sure seems like Loras would be okay with that. Theon made his way back to his homeland just in time for the 'Kingsmoot' from what I understand. I don't entirely think we need a ton of focus on the Iron Islands, I'm excited to see how they handle the newly reformed relationship between Theon and Yara.Lastly, Dany made a huge step forward this week as she has seemingly taken over all of the remaining Dothraki by once again walking through the flames. Dany has always had great ending scenes for this show, but this one meant a little more. With the Doth on her side, she may finally have enough to move onward to Kings Landing. We knew it would eventually happened, but I'm glad it wasn't dragged out till the last episode of the season. It also served as a great mirror to the 10th episode of season 1. Well done Dave and Dan, well done.Overall, 'Book of the Stranger' showcased the greatness that Game of Thrones can be when it balances set up with pay off impeccably. Season 6 just keeps getting better.+Sansa & Jon finally+Lannisters & Tyrells working together?+Dany walks through the flames again+The Letter+Baelish up to no good-Tired of High Sparrow's speeches10/10",

Less physical performance in this episode, but with acting that makes her the standout character...

Sure, we haven't seen more of Arya's story-arc where she got her sight back and decides to have no name, but this episode is where Season 6 might get more and more compelling.The story remains as interesting and has some really effective moments were Sansa and Jon Snow reunite and vow to rescue Rickon Stark after receiving a letter from Ramsay Bolton along with the finale where Daenerys Targaryen taking charge of all the khalasars recalls her story elements of the beginning of the first season and does so perfectly. The writing is at the high standards left by Home and Oathbreaker and the performances are still superb with Kit Harington, Emilia Clarke, and Sophie Turner giving out some of their best acting. The directing is stupendous, the pacing takes it time to bring some depth and it succeeds, the editing is solid, the sets and scenery are still lavish, and Ramin Djawadi continues to bring some beautifully well-done atmosphere and some exemplary emotion to it (OK, I'm not British, but I always wanted to use that word).Overall, Book of the Stranger continues where the last two episodes left off. It's engaging, fiery, and touching. Highly recommended! :)",

Their lives have no value in front of the queen's life. If you do something wrong, it will always be considered wrong, be it the queen of a state or someone else. So what will the king do now? The mother and her honor on the one hand and the wife and her honor on the other. One man changed himself after enduring repeated tortures, but one day he returned home with the courage of another man to help his family. Some people become demons out of greed for power and some people are born as demons. A queen is always a queen. No one has ever been able to bind him, never will.

                    "content": "I'm going to start by saying this episode was just straight out fantastic. The past week I've watched a few episodes from season 1 and I was actually surprised how contained the show started. We all now know Game of Thrones as this show spread over a whole globe with multiple stories happening at once but we forget that the show started with only a few locations. What I really liked they have started doing this season is starting to limit the story lines. We got this last year when we saw our first team up with Tyrion and Varys joining Daenarys in Meeren. Now we finally reunited two Starks, Sansa and our favourite bastard Jon. I thought that everything at Castle Black with them was fantastic and I really hope that we continue to see them together and start reuniting other members of the Stark family.It would usually be really weird to be 4 episodes into a season and still seeing characters for the first time for the season, but not in Game of Thrones. This episode we got our first appearance of Little Finger and Margery. I really liked the Little Finger scene because it really reminded us of the character he is. In just 1 scene this season, he has managed to manipulate this childish king into giving him his army. That really stood out to me how we often forget about Little Finger and his is mostly a background character but in the end he is playing the long game. I honestly wouldn't be surprised to see him sitting on that uncomfortable throne in he end. The Margery scene wasn't big in anyway but it was a well rounded scene that reintroduced us to the character for the first time his season. I liked how her appearance really tied into what Cersi and Jamie are planning in King's Landing and trying to manipulate the small council into taking down the High Sparrow. On the High Sparrow he was again outstanding. I really loved his scene with Margery and how he spoke his life story to how he became who he was.Something small that I noticed this episode that I thought was really well was the camera work. Through the scene with the High Sparrow and Margery I thought they really controlled the camera well and it enhanced the power of the High Sparrow as he told his story. The other place in the episode I noticed it was during some of Tyrion's scenes. His scenes were again outstanding, his delivery was spot on and I really love how he has taken on the power role. I thought there were certain times where the used the position of Tyrion in the set and the height of the camera to give Tyrion a bigger appearance. We are never going to view him as anything more than a midget but I like how they are using camera angles to give him a more powerful appearance as he gains more power during the series.There was something that really stood out to me this episode that made me really enjoy this episode and it was the ending. I said last week that I felt the Daenarys storyline has really hit a halt lately and I want to see her fighting for power and taking over armies like we saw her so early in the series. This was the episode she did it. Her speech she gave to the Dothraki was really powerful, something we haven't seen her do in such a long time. Daenarys was introduced to us this determined and powerful character and like I said last week, they shied away from that. So it was great to see her back taking control and being the powerful and dominate force we know she can.This episode was fantastic. There is still so much I didn't touch on in the review but there wasn't one thing I didn't like. What I loved the most about it is how apart from the end, there weren't that many major moments and for the most part it was just basic story progression for the series, but that didn't restrict the episode. Some people may consider these filler episodes but in the end, I don't care if it is the episode that everything happens or an episode that is well executed story telling, a good episode is a good episode and that is what we got tonight.10/10 - See more reviews at thenotsonerdynerd.wordpress.com/",

Because the bad ones are too bad to be overlooked.A poser and a leper (Daario and Jorah) cross a desert on foot, in the same exact time as the Dothraki. OK, not a big deal. They enter Vaes Dothrak (which is now in an arid wasteland somehow), kill two men for no obvious reason other than risking revealing themselves, and then happen to intercept Daenerys, who has a better idea than sneaking out. You see, her judgement by the Khal council is approaching. So she stands before them, and tells them she will rule the Dothraki. They laugh at her, and then she drops a few braziers. On the ground. On the dirt ground. MAGICALLY, these braziers were secret Napalm bombs brought to Vaes Dothrak from Vietnam, so the fires spread (across the dirt) in milliseconds and envelop the entire giant hut in flames. The Khals try to exit, but Daario and Jorah have killed the guards (in the exact middle of a city with the population density of Bombay where weapons are forbidden) and barricaded the door. The door of a hut made of reed or something, which a small battalion of Conan the Barbarians are completely unable to even try and break. They also allow Daenerys to drop all four Napalms without stopping her, even though she takes surprisingly long breaks between each drop. THEN, the Dothraki, THRILLED that this woman has murdered all their leaders inside their holy city, worship her. You know how everyone just LOVED it when Walder Frey did something similar? Yep, pretty much the same thing.In other news, Davos finally remembers to ask Melissandre what happened to Stannis, when Brienne shows up with a smug look to inform the two she killed him. She also reveals she knows it was actually Melissandre who killed Renly. But apparently she doesn't feel obliged by her oath to do anything about that, because, hell, do you need a reason?(PS) Also, all this time nobody in Meereen has noticed Daenerys is missing. It's not like leaving on the back of a dragon in front of a lot of people is something anyone would notice.",

It is perfectly paced this time around, with each character getting a reasonable amount of screen time without it being rushed over.The scenes with Tyrion and others have to some of his best scenes in a long time. The writing is yet again fantastic. Seeing two characters meet up again after so long, was one of the most tear-jerking scenes in a TV show period. Cersei becoming more of a bad ass this time around, gaining others to her side, and it looks like House Lannister and Tyrell might actually form an alliance. This episode was great throughout, there was not one dull moment, and again with Ramsey being one step ahead of everyone around him, leading to a shocking scene. But all of this leads to one of the best endings in the show so far. Throughout seasons 4-5, people have said that Dany has had little to do, but if they say that again after this episode, well, they are just haters. She shows her true powers, since season 1. It is all played around to feel like season 1 finale, and it doesn't disappoint. This also helps when there is an extraordinary soundtrack playing in the background.Brilliant episode, season 6 is the best season along with season 4. 10/10",

This episode was about two things: it was about brothers & sisters, and it was about women focusing on getting what they want. After their wonderfully touching reunion (seriously, if you didn't start welling up I'd suggest you aren't even human), Jon and Sansa sit to discuss both the past and the future. This is brother and sister looking at how they've gotten to where they are, before working out where to go next - except their opinions clash. Jon doesn't want to fight anymore, but Sansa is insistent that they must reclaim Winterfell. Jon refuses to even entertain the idea, until a letter comes from Ramsay stating that he has their younger brother. Sansa pulls Jon around to her side, and they begin their plan to invade and reclaim Winterfell. It's a powerful series of sequences for a number of reasons, but the fact that the episode allows the female character to sway the mind of the male with regards to war makes this all the more important.This theme of brothers & sisters all resonated in a variety of other stories tonight. We saw Theon return to Yara, as she tells him to stop crying and focus on their future. He tells him he will help her rule the Iron Islands. We had Margaery being permitted to visit her brother Loras in his cell, where she instructs him to stay strong and reminds him that the future of their house relies on him. We have Cersei and Jaime interrupting the small council meeting to discuss the High Sparrow with Kevan and Olenna, yet while it's Jaime who relays the plan to the others, Cersei remains in the frame behind him, and it's not difficult to work out that this is her plan and not his. These stories all focus on the brother & sister relationship, but allow the woman to take centre stage and focus on getting what she desires. The women of Game of Thrones may not actually accomplish much in this episode, but this wasn't an episode about accomplishment: this was an episode about strategy, and about scheming. We see brothers and sisters strategising and scheming together here, but the sister is the one leading the plan. It's a testament to the show's history that this feels fully natural, and not shoehorned in for the sake of a feminist approach. It feels real.So while Sansa, Yara, Margaery and Cersei focused on beginning their plans, there was one woman who skipped right past the scheming and went straight into putting her plan into action. That woman is, of course, Daenerys Targaryen. After a slow but thoughtful beginning to her season, Dany's narrative has lurched forward with tonight's instalment. She has simultaneously broken free from the Dosh Khaleen, and proved to the entire Dothraki horde that she is a worthy leader. After the episode focused so heavily on female empowerment it was only fitting that it should wrap up with Dany, she is the show's feminist icon after all. As the various Khals taunt and mock Dany after she tells them she would make a better leader to the Dothraki, she sets the temple ablaze to kill them all and emerges from the flames naked and unharmed, as the entire Dothraki army recognise her power and bow to her. It's a powerful and poignant sequence, made even more exciting by the narrative progression it also represents. Emilia Clarke also gives her best performance here in a long time, so calm in the earlier moments yet so controlling and authoritative as the sequence escalates. It's a terrific scene in every last respect, and easily the strongest material of the season thus far.Not every story managed to fit the brother and sister theme tonight as Tyrion, Varys, Grey Worm and Missandei attempt to persuade the masters of Slaver's Bay to cut off their funding of the Sons of the Harpy and return to the slave-free environment Daenerys set up. While her sequences work to prove that Dany can make a great leader, this sequence also show her flaws in a powerful position: another great thing about this episode's portrayal of women, they're allowed to have flaws and make mistakes but still be just as powerful. This sequence was home to some of the most interesting and thought-provoking dialogue the show has ever offered, especially as Tyrion debates with Grey Worm and Missandei - who plays a large role in the debate, continuing the episode's focus on women. They discuss their differences in tactics in a fittingly intellectual manner, and I cannot wait to see where the show takes these characters next. \"Book of the Stranger\" is a stellar episode of Game of Thrones, boasting one of the most well plotted and thematically exciting scripts the show has had in a long time, as well as a plethora of powerhouse performances. The only issue is that the bar has really been set high now, and next week has got one hell of a task to live up to this.",

                    "content": "A superb episode that benefits from having extra time to map out its storytelling, Book of the Stranger is a maelstrom of death, deceit and reunion. Unlike other seasons, Season 6 has gone straight for the kill with its plot developments and they're hitting the mark so far. A quiet premiere, led to a tumultuous second episode, and an intriguing third episode, led to this exciting story for episode four. So much is happening, it's sometimes hard to keep track of each character, but I'll try.Firstly, we have the incredibly touching reunion of Jon and Sansa, so touching in fact, that it didn't need words to explain. Along with Ramsey's threatening letter, which conveniently brings Tormund to Jon's side, the North looks to be in quite a precarious position, and even Melisandre is falling in line with Jon. The only thing is, I feel Edd may perhaps try to steer Jon around to the realistic situation, involving White Walkers. As an aside, it's great to see Littlefinger and the Vale again, with a tantalising development that Baelish has persuaded Lord Rob to fight for Sansa's freedom. In Winterfell, it's a scene that I was dreading to happen, but I knew it would, where Osha is killed by Ramsey, who gives us another reason (adding to a long list here) to despise his existence.Briefly, in Pyke, we have another reunion, but one that's not so touching. It seems Yara, understandably, has lost a lot of her affection for Theon since she attempted to rescue all that time ago, and she's still bitter about it. But she eats her words when she hears that her brother is willing to support her claim in the Kingsmoot. In King's Landing, tensions are most definitely boiling as Margaery sees through the High Sparrow's symbolic words and warns her brother not to succumb to their torture and temptation. Meanwhile, Lady Olenna and Queen Mother Cersei have miraculously agreed on something, if for entirely different reasons. If the Tyrell army comes to King's Landing, who knows what exciting things could happen in the Capitol very soon. Things are moving quickly in Meereen, with Tyrion meeting rather convivially with the masters of three cities in Slaver's Bay, Yunkai, Astapor and Volantis. His diplomacy quickly pays off, but I wonder whether his offer is enough to persuade them to change their ways. I sympathise with Missandei and Grey Worm, however, that his plan is closer to helping the masters stay rich rather than freeing the slaves.But finally, the biggest developments of all, in Vaes Dothrak Jorah and Daario have arrived to rescue their Queen. Despite Jorah's confident plan, it soon backfires to the point where they're forced to commit a terrible sin in the Dothraki city. They do locate Daenerys, however, and she has a plan of her own. The final scene of the episode is a great call-back to the first season as we are reminded of the true reason why Targaryens have a dragon as their sigil. Daenerys succeeds in burning more Khals than you can count and gains the support, albeit surprised support, of the entire Khalasar outside. It's great to see Daario's reaction as well, as he realises how powerful she truly is. The only thing is missing is Drogon. A high-stakes episode with enough politics to balance the action. Season 6 is quickly on its way to becoming my favourite season so far, which sort of makes me feel sorry for George R. R. Martin, to see his work, albeit a transformed version of his work, being continued without him. Let's just hope that his final books match the series or even better, top them, and everyone will be happy.",

One of my favorite scenes was Little Finger owning Lord Royce. Little Finger completely flips the threat on himself onto Lord Royce as Robbin is easily manipulated by Baelish who will really rule as Lord of the Vale. Curious to see Sansa encounter Baelish again. He did send her off to Ramsay but she needs the Vale so she will need to quickly forgive. Tyrion does some negotiating and acts in Daenery's absence and gets some backlash from his colleagues for his proposal to the Masters of Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis. Jorah and Daario reach Daenerys and attend the dosh khaleen. Daenerys heats things up and wins some support in the process. Can't wait to see the Tyrell's and Lannister's take on the High Sparrow and the faith and then Jon, Sansa, the wildlings, the Vale and any northern houses who will rally behind Jon and Sansa to take on Ramsay. Brienne gloats and talks some s*** to Davos and Melisandre. Cersei, Jaime, the Queen of Thorns and Kevin Lannister discuss working towards a common goal. Theon and Yara reunite in an iron born way, but never the less unite to make Yara the leader of the iron islands. Jon gets \"the pink letter\" as Ramsay personally calls Jon out and claims to have Rickon and will flay all the wildlings and makes a few other threats which influence their response to the letter. This episode really set the stage for the plot line in the north, Mereen and Vaas Dorthrak, King's landing. Can't wait to see the battles in the North. King's landing is about to go war as well as Mereen. The next 6 episodes should be amazing.",

The setting with the Dothraki leaders is one of the best moments that characterize the quality of the show, but also the excellent playing of the beloved Emilia. You are stunned by the style of dealing with Dothraki's leaders, the expression of devaluation and disgust towards them is one of the best I can remember. That's why I will get stuck many times in this episode and in this scene.",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Feel the same way with \"The Door\" as with \"Home\" and \"Book of the Stranger\". \"The Door\" is one of the best episodes of Season 6, which settled much quicker and more consistently than Season 5 generally, and a standout of the latter seasons, an episode that has everything that makes 'Game of Thrones' as great as it is and what it's all about. It is one of the most acclaimed episodes of the season, have also seen fans and critics cite it as one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes, and can totally see why on all counts.'Game of Thrones', even in the lesser episodes, has at least one great or more scene. \"The Door\" has passion, sensitivity, thrills and emotion throughout, but there are parts that are especially good. The action with the White Walkers is spectacularly exciting but it is the emotional parts that register most. Daenerys and Jorah's scene is very heartfelt, but the one that brought me to tears the most was the devastating climax and Hodor's revelation.All the performances as always are great across the board. Kristian Naim (in a heart-breaking performance), Max Von Sydow and Emilia Clarke are the standouts.Visually, \"The Door\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Door\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. The writing is thought-provoking and very rich in layers with plenty of passion and sensitivity. The characters continue to be interesting and memorable, while the pacing and direction are tight and there is the sense that things are moving forward.Altogether, one of Season 6's and 'Game of Thrones' best. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

But the scene of the terrible pain, the end of a long effort for protect young Stark , the last trait of a not so significant character remains terrible in profound sense. So, a great episode.",

On the Iron Island, Theon supports his sister Yara to be the Queen; however their uncle Euron Greyjoy arrives and claims the throne for him. In Vaes Dothrak, Jorah shows his greyscale to Daenerys and discloses his love for her and Deaenery commands him to find a cure to his disease. In Meereen, people are in temporary peace and he has an encounter with a Red Priestess. Bran disobeys the Three-Eyed Raven and has a vision alone of the White Walkers. Out of the blue, he is touched by Night's Kings with tragic consequences. Sansa, Jon and Davos plot an alliance with other Houses from the North to retake Winterfell. After the excellent \"Book of the Stranger\", the overrated \"The Door\" is only a reasonable episode of \"Game of Thrones\". Sansa wants to overtake Winterfell and she plans a possible alliance, but does not tell to her stepbrother what happened to her. Every fan is probably looking forward to see the despicable Ransay defeated and destroyed. Yara and Theon's decision to leave the Iron Islands with the fleet will certainly lead to another fight; but why did they do it?. One good moment of the show is the reaction of Daenerys when Jorah discloses his love for her. The emotional response of Daenerys is heartbreaking. Aria is stalled in the same stupid condition since the first episode of this season. Tyrion has the most imbecile attitudes and there are viewers that enjoy. Bran's attitude cost the lives of his friends including Hodor. The explanation for his alias (Hold the Door... Hodor) is senseless. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"The Door\"",

Later he decides to have a vision on his own and in it he sees the leader of the White Walkers, The Night King, and, what is more, the Night King sees him and grabs his arm. The Three-Eyed Raven tells him that that he must leave as the Night King now knows where he is and will be coming for him. As he has another vision they are attacked and we learn why Hodor says nothing but 'Hodor'. Elsewhere Sansa meets Petyr Baelish and rejects his offer of help; Yara Greyjoy claims the throne of the Iron Islands but has to flee with Theon when her Uncle Euron takes the throne. Across the Narrow Sea Arya is given another chance when she is told to kill an actress but having seen her questions whether she deserves to die.This was another great episode; interestingly the best parts included Bran, a character who had taken a relatively minor role until this season. His story provided some interesting revelations; most notably concerning the origins of the White Walkers, something I hadn't previously thought about. His story also provided some great action as the White Walker's launch their attack. After many episodes where Arya just got beaten it was nice to see her story develop; she even got to smile while watching a play about the events in Westeros\u0085 at least until it included her family. The events on the Iron Islands were very interesting and served to properly introduce Euron Greyjoy; Pilou Asb\u00e6k impressed in the role; not that that was a big surprise having been previously impressed by his performances in various Danish productions. Overall as the sixth season reaches its half way point things remain as interesting as ever.",

                    "content": "Every time I think this season may take a step back or give us a filler episode, it does just the opposite. Granted, there are still certain story lines that don't seem to have any impact in the larger grand scheme of things, but the good far outweighed the bad in 'The Door'.Once again beginning in Castle Black, we got to see Sansa completely shut down Littlefinger who claimed he didn't know of Ramsay's insanity at all. For someone who comes across as one of the smartest people in all of Westeros, it seems unlikely he wouldn't have heard a thing, but I guess I can buy into it. No matter, seeing Sansa shut down his offer and really come into her own as a leader of the North, was satisfying after all that she went through last season. I'm also glad to see Jon and Sansa get on the road and recruit the other houses. At the same time, I feel Brienne and Sansa's time together was all too short so I sure hope it isn't the last we see of that relationship.Continuing with the heavy Stark episode was Arya in Braavos. It's not necessarily that her scenes have been bad, they haven't. I just don't entirely see the reason why each episode we see the same sort of arc with her, Waif and Jaqen H'ghar. Arya gets her butt kicked, Jaqen doesn't trust her, and she pleads for it anyway. I thought perhaps with the comedic theatre scenes with Lady Stork we may get to see Arya in action as 'no one', but it wasn't meant to be.After Dany had a very big unburnt moment last week, she took a backseat to the Stark conflict, but it wasn't any less impactful. Seeing Jorah finally reveal his greyscale and his love for the Queen of Dragons was heartbreaking. Hearing her tell him she needs him on her side once she takes the Iron Throne was bittersweet, and it almost seems to hint that he may make it out of this season alive after all. That is, if and when he finds himself a cure.Speaking of Dany's claim to the Throne, she may have a King to rule with as Euron declared his plan to marry Daenerys and conquer all of Westeros. Meanwhile, the \"first servant of the Lord of the Light\" aka Kinvara is also looking to help Dany's claim to the throne. Whatever her plans are with Tyrion and Varys, I instantly bought into her character during her monologue to Varys. Lastly, Bran sure had a big week with his visions and flashbacks to some key plot revelations with the White Walkers. It was revealed via flashback that the Children of the Forest were directly responsible for the creation of the Night's King way back in the day. As if we thought that was big enough, it was also revealed that Bran unintentionally was the reason for Hodor's lack of intelligence. The entire sequence was beautifully edited and scored in what is one of this show's all-time great scenes/reveals. That's some season 1 story planning finally coming to fruition years later. And I can't deny how impressive the execution of this scene and this entire episode was. Season 6 just keeps getting better.+Sansa is just awesome+Iron Islands material moves along+Jorah's heartbreaking reveals+White Walker material+Hold the freaking door-Arya stuff seems repetitive9.4/10",

Maybe it's a small thing but it needed to be known. There is a saying that it is very important to do the right thing at the right time. That's what I understand.

After so much build up in season 5, it has exploded and week after week they seem to be hitting home run for home run.This week was no different. So much happened this episode and it was all amazing. Starting we at Castle Black we got to see Sansa and Little Finger meet each other for the first time since Sansa was sent to marry Ramsey. What I really like in this scene was how even when Little Finger was under the hammer and Sansa was dishing it all out to him, he was still pulling his strings. Dropping hints and tips to Sansa that she ended up taking on board and telling Jon about when they were trying to work out how they would return Winterfell to the Stark name. Coming from this we also got the extremely entertaining scene with Brienne and Tormund. I really hope they play this out. It would be amazing to see a team up like that and together see them taking out White Walkers. While the Daenarys scene was brief it was really good. We finally got Captain Friendzone admitting his love for Daenarys, a scene that was well over due. Apart from that point, we got to see Daenarys leading an army once again. I've always liked when Daenarys is in charge and she is showing her determination and starting to build towards her end attack for the throne. We got perhaps one of my favourite fight scenes since the Mountain popped the head of The Viper. I really loved Arya's fight scene with the other faceless assassin. It was extremely brutal and the way it was choreographed was amazing and was paced really smoothly and well. Of course it wouldn't be Game of Thrones without a massive ending. Hold the Door. Finally we get to see how Hoodor transitioned from Willis to the Hoodor we know. I thought the was they did it was amazing. I really like how with Bran we are really starting to explore his powers as a Warg and are being able to see how he can influence the past. I thought the scene itself with Hoodor holding the door shut to stop the White Walkers was extremely emotional the the way they cut between present day and Bran Warging into the past was brilliant. I'm calling it now, White Walker Hoodor for the end of the season. Of course the other big things to come out of Bran's scenes is we learned how the first White Walkers were create by the tree people and that the White Walkers are now on the chase for Bran. I'm not quite sure why they are after Bran specifically but I'm sure it will all be explained in the next few weeks. Yet again, one of the most amazing episodes of the whole series has been produced out of this wonderful thing we call season 6. This is why Game of Thrones is so highly regarded as one of the best TV shows of all time and it's really good to see that not having books to based the remaining episodes off is yet to hinder the quality. 10/10",

                    "content": "I haven't been kind to game of thrones since at least last year's end of the season. But I can't deny this episode managed to end on perhaps the most tragic moment of the series so far. I'm not giving it a 10/10, because the rest of the episode didn't avoid the gaps in logic B&W have made their bread and butter. But the ending, well. The ending would be enough to turn even the worst episode of the show to one of the best.Let's start on a light tone, with the customary bashing. Brienne is getting more obnoxious every time she appears (granted, this may be partly because I consider Stannis' death the most unforgivable crime committed in television - if not in real life - ever). Petyr Baelish, a character who for several seasons was almost unparalleled in cunning and scheming seems to finally realise what everyone else had noticed. That this whole \"Sansa to Ramsay\" plan was incredibly idiotic and only served TV purposes. As for the plan to unite the northern houses, it becomes evident that the show is replacing Stannis with Knows-nothing-Snow. Which on any other day would be infuriating, but today, I'll let it pass.The Arya storyline was good, and finally moved a little forward. No complaints. Nor in the little bit of Daenerys, they were all exhausted on last week's ludicrous development. As for the red priestess in Meereen, I'll keep a neutral view for now (btw, Quaithe has appeared in the show. Have they forgotten about her?).The Ironborn Kingsmoot was...well, rather disappointing, as was to be expected. When you insert a storyline 3-4 years too late, chances are you don't consider it important enough to present it as you should. This - optically unconvincing - Euron wins the Driftwood Crown with a rather uninspiring speech and arguments. He confesses to murdering Balon, but no one cares? Com' on. He presents a plan that shouldn't appear at all feasible to the ironborn without the book's dragon horn thing. Then, Asha...no, wait, Yara, Theon and a few others steal most of the fleet and flee. You'd think they could kill Euron during the drowning ceremony or something - he JUST demonstrated that regicide isn't a big deal. Anyway.But let's go back beyond the wall. Now, even here, there are issues of continuity. The attempt to give the White Walkers an origin story is nonsensical and anyway poor in conception, at least as it is given. The war between the children of the forest and the first men took place 4000 years before the walkers appeared (this isn't a show/book difference, I'm fairly sure the bits of lore thrown during the series follow the same chronology). The point where Max Von Sydow says \"you have to get away NOW\", and then just takes more trips down memory lane with Bran only to waste time till they are trapped (really, that's the sole reason. He just says \"now you have to be me\" but nothing of what transpires during their vision thing seems to help in that regard) is sloppy.However. None of these things matters much. The ending, with the revelation of what Hodor means, with the poor simpleton standing his ground, with Meera just running away and leaving him behind, is simply stunning. Shocking. Beautiful. It also, to no one's surprise, comes directly from George Martin. Which leads to a sad reminder. If the books were ready sooner (ok, it should have been much sooner), we might have still had a fantastic TV show. Adapting Martin's plot, Benioff and Weiss have been doing a fantastic job. It's when they think on their own that they mess up. But today I will leave them be. Today they can get away from my whining. Today Hodor held the door.",

The scene with Dan and Jorah was great to see, and finally Jorah might get the peace he has been fighting for. We also get our first look at the new Red Woman, and it looks like her presence is going to mirror that of our already known Red Woman.Other than the scenes at Castle Black and at Meerern, and with Arya furthering her training (with a brilliant theatre scene), this episode shines at the end.Wow. The final moments of this episode broke me in two, not even the Red Wedding or Hardhome made me gasp and shake with intensity. It plays out all happy then suddenly does what Game of Thrones does, and pull it from under you. We lose two beloved characters, while you could argue that one is not really a character, but has been with us since season 1 episode 1 as a small cute furry bundle of joy. Seeing what the White Walkers can do has given us something else to fear from them. I am eager to see what comes next for our characters, whats left of them.I could go on to say that this is one of the greatest TV episodes of all times. If you don't like it, you're not a Game of Thrones fan.10/10",

                    "content": "And I only mean 2 of the 4 we saw in this episode. Rickon is a non- factor, and kinda always has been. Arya and Jon are both great, and clearly important, but I'm talking about those other two. Besides, Arya is no one, and Jon is a Snow.First, Sansa. I'm still irritated that she is so eager to go to war, knowing that her role will be an REMF. But then, in this episode she is willing to dismiss additional troops for the sake of her pride. I'm not trying to suggest what happened to her was OK, but it wasn't Littlefinger's doing, and right now killing the Bolton's with extreme prejudice is the entire point. Then, in a strategy meeting, she lies to her brother, whom she trusts, but he obviously shouldn't trust her. I've never liked her character, and she is getting worse to me. I hope that, somehow, she still becomes a violent casualty of this war. Maybe fly of the moon door. Spoiled Stark.Second, Bran. Now, was he, or was he not supposed to skin-walk on his own like that? Pretty much like going swimming without a lifeguard, when you are still learning how. And, what was the result of it? Got his wolf killed. Lost the tree. Dead Children. Dead raven. Dead Hodor. CAUSED Hodor's ailment? ... And all because he's impetuous? Stick his ass in the tree so that people don't have to drag him around anymore. Bratty Stark.Overall, I thought it was a slower episode. Frenetic finale, and a wicked turn on the Islands. I absolutely expected Yara to rule, so I appreciate that there are still surprises like that in the story. I like the Red Woman 2.0, and I like Jorah's new quest. I hope that gets turned into a mini-series of it's own. I thought the play was a nice touch as well. This episode felt more like it was just moving the pieces around the board, as opposed to actually doing anything and driving the story forward.",

She even learnt from him (the very best) and chose not to tell Jon about where she got her information from. Littlefinger is shown to be in great discomfort in this scene, which is a rare sight for one of the most quietly intimidating and powerful people in all of Westeros.Varys - another man of knowledge and power - was made very uncomfortable in this episode as he was confronted with his greatest fear/enemy: magic. It was so very strange seeing both Littlefinger and Varys in their states, yet it was a gentle reminder that nobody is entirely invulnerable. As a wise man once said: power resides where men believe it resides.We were also treated to another emotional, albeit short, scene with Daenerys and Jorah, in which we receive a long-awaited pardon. Jorah declares his love for Daenerys, and in return she finally forgives him for his treason. She sends him away with a (final?) mission: find a cure for his greyscale. Unfortunately, I'm not too confident that he'll actually find that cure, or even if they'll meet again, but I can only be optimistic and pray that he does and they do.Euron Greyjoy has won the King's Moot; alas, he was too late and as a result, Yara and Theon have escaped with (seemingly) all of the ships. Where will they go? Will they head over to Meereen themselves and implement Euron's plan before he can? It seems unlikely, but I'm not sure where else they can go. At least we now know Daenerys will have her ships soon!Arya's training seems to have been stunted once more. Jaqen seems very skeptical of her and her ability to serve the Many-Faced God. Perhaps, if things don't go according to plan for Arya with her next mission, we'll see her leaving Braavos sooner than expected.The final scene was completely traumatising. Bran! You mustn't linger too long or you'll drown! Do the Starks ever listen? Had he been more careful this tragedy could have been avoided. I was not expecting to see the White Walkers in this episode, nor was I expecting the death of the Three Eyed Raven, Hodor, and Summer (Bran's direwolf). We learnt how Hodor became Hodor and witnessed the tragedy unfold before us. It was honestly heartbreaking. Hodor died fighting and doing what he always had done so well: protecting Bran.I do sincerely hope that Bran has learnt enough in his time in training and that he can put to good use what he's been taught. He's one of the final pieces of the puzzle to defeating the White Walkers, so his survival is absolutely paramount.No King's Landing or Ramsay storyline in this episode, sadly, but we've next week to look forward to, and I imagine it will be quite eventful given all the tricks both Cersei and the High Sparrow have up their sleeves.This episode's culmination marks the halfway point for season six - can you believe we're here already? With only five episodes to go, I'm already starting to fear for the end of the season.",

Because it's one that cares so much about its story that even something as apparently meaningless as a repeated word by a seemingly comic relief character can mean more than meets the eye.",

Bran's new ability that is revealed during the closing moments of this episode is the biggest thing in the show since the White Walker's existence was proved.The storyboarding is once again epic. The episode was perfectly paced and so is this season so far. It started off very slow and it looked like the showrunners are stalling the storyline. But now we know, it was all a perfect setup for this mid-season climax.Suffices to say, tonight's episode ranks among the very best of GoT. The storyline has finally picked up some pace this season and old mysteries are being unraveled.I definitely, look forward to next week's episode in the hope that it will continue what's been set off in 'The Door' and build on it in a massive way!",

                    "content": "\"The Door\" is a travesti of what \"Game of Thrones\" was and has been in most part of the series. Don't take me wrong because I don't have anything against someone pretending to be someone else, I simply have everything against this particular season pretending to be what \"Game of Thrones\" originally was: a masterpiece.And please, I am a fan of the series, don't get \"sparrowed\" on me, but \"Game of Thrones\" (the series) is much more than this.Max Von Sydow astonishing qualities as actor were stupidly put in a corner on this season and \"Three-Eyed Raven\" was badly introduced as a character (with Mr. Sydow as actor) without any kind of literary depth; the scenario was poorly done again without any kind of mystery or dimension just a plain dirty muddy dark hole with a netted tree, and the \"Children of Earth\" (Sprites) \"playing\" in the background like extras resembling more a vain sketch. Both Three-Eyed Raven and The Children of Earth are far away too important to be presented in this cheap way...No time nor narrative enough to get attached with these unknown species and by consequence no emotional response watching the sacrifice of one of them exploding himself for Bran's safety; equally, no emotional response when realizing that the \"White Walkers\" were after all their creations. Just the visualization of some actors wearing some banal fantasy costumes \"pretending\" to be fashionable in a Gothic Baroque way playing the role of some androgynous creatures.So, we had to digest the Dothraki language bullshit but non-human creatures with thousands of years old now can speak English? The ritual was excruciatingly bad not only in terms of bad FX but also in terms of narrative: The sacrifice happened thousands of years before the contemporary timeline of the series. How it is that the scenario, Children of Earth's appearances, even the facial traits of the executioner are the same as in the present time this episode is happening? (Not to mention that the King of the White Walkers is constantly changing his appearance in opposition) Even so, how is it that the narrative of the analepse (flashback) is so trivially put as if something secondary which happened a couple of tens of years although somehow relevant is being described? How can this discrepancy be, taking into account \"Game of Thrones\" HQ standards? Is this the right way to disclosure such important information?Take the introduction of the Giants as comparison (S03 E01), or the original \"White Walkers\" (S01 E01).And by the way, White Walkers are now able to transport themselves instantly to another places? I'm not even mentioning the mediocre characterizations and roles of Pilou Asb\u00e6k and Michiel Huisman as Euron Greyjoy and Daario Naharis. Nor their narratives which in the best attributions are secondary. Nor even the boring, boring, boring Sand Snakes... (I know they don't appear on this episode, but I'm afraid they will in the next ones)Nor referring to Emilia Clarke's snotty farewell to Sir Iain Glen... or Sansa's or... almost every single aspect of this episode (and the season).Except maybe for Hodor, not at all for his death, which sounded too much cruel and paradoxical for me, but by Isaac Hempstead Wright and Sam Coleman performances and most specially by Kristian Nairn's superb dramatization.This nasty habit of killing characters just for the sake of shocking is getting banal and dormant in response. I believe that even the amount of time a Semi-giant is able to hold a door pushed by hundreds of zombies, is not enough for a girl pulling an improvised Travois carrying a crippled teenager to safely escape (except of course if a miracle happens).Even if Hodor's fate was dramatically forged by Bran's mistake which is a well written piece of script, the presentation of it \"sounds\" poor and \"unjustifiable\". It sounds as if Hodor was sacrificed for the sake of this episode.We waited for 5 seasons for... this?",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"Blood of My Blood\" is something of a let-down after two incredible episodes in \"Book of the Stranger\" and \"The Door\". It is still a very well done episode though, despite having some faults, and to be honest following on from episodes as good as those two is daunting and for it to be on the same level would have been a monumental challenge. It doesn't achieve this challenge/feat completely, but it almost like because of the good elements being so good. There are faults here. Have to agree that Daenerys' role in the episode is dull and neither plot-progressing or develops her character much, her speech doesn't really stir the spirits either. Tommen's character needs to become more interesting because there is not enough to him yet to make him a love to hate him character, at the moment he's fairly ordinary. Jaime's development seems to have gone backwards rather than progressed. Pacing is occasionally a bit slow. However, there is a huge amount that works in \"Blood of My Blood\" that stops it from being bloodless. It is not as eventful or as tight pace-wise as the previous two episodes and revelations and such are milder and don't have the same amount of punch. The episode does do a great job with Sam and Gilly as well as the character of Benjen. Standing out just as much is the story with High Sparrow and Arya's character and story is progressing and the most interesting it was up to this point. Can't fault the acting. Jonathan Pryce was always great as High Sparrow, he's superb here. Maisie Williams is another standout, and Sam and Gilly are splendidly characterised.Visually, \"Blood of My Blood\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"Blood of My Blood\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. Plenty of layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing if not quite consistent. In conclusion, could have been much more but very well done on the most part. 8/10 Bethany Cox",

The long play scene with Arya is tiresome again although the character work after that is better. I could have done without the endless Sam and Gilly scenes which are far too much time to be spending on minor characters who have little impact on things in the show. Scenes with the High Sparrow are exciting although they do end in an anticlimax, but that shows that GAME OF THRONES is still doing its job by delivering the unexpected. Fun to see another old character in the form of Uncle Benjen returning, which means that the Blackfish and Brotherhood of Banners aside we've almost caught up with all of the old-timers this season. Some great CGI at the climax, but Daenerys' stirring speech to the Dothraki seems superfluous given that they all decided to follow her anyway at the end of the last episode.",

He gets to see Margery and as the Tyrell's arrive to keep her from taking that fateful walk, he walks out on the steps with her, swearing allegiance to that pack of wolves who act in the name of their god. There is further action with Bran and a rescue. Finally, Dany is back in the saddle (the one on the dragon, who has now healed). Arya chooses to return to the living and takes her sword back (the cool thing is her incredible training). So now it will be a week again to get back to the heavy lifting.

However when they are having dinner, his father Randyll discovers that Gilly is a Wildling and insults the couple. Tommen meets the High Sparrow that allows him to visit Margaery and she confesses that she repented her sins. Out of the blue, Jaime commands the Tyrell army through King's Landing to release Margaery and Loras, but he is surprised by the revelation of an alliance of the Faith and the Crown. In Braavos, Arya meets Lady Crane and they have a conversation about acting. Then Arya saves the actress from poisoning. However Waif witnesses her behavior and reports to Jaqen that asks her to kill Arya. Meanwhile Arya retrieves the Needle from the hidden place on the rocks and brings it to her room. Daenerys and Daario have a conversation about the number of ships she needs to cross the Narrow Sea with her army. Then she leaves him and returns riding Drogon. \"Blood of My Blood\" is the sixth episode where Arya finally has an attitude about Jaqen orders. The segment with Bran with his visions is annoying. Sam and Gilly are offended and now they will live outside Horn Hill. The alliance between The Crown and the Faith by the silly Tommen will be certainly destroyed by Jaime. The speech of Daenerys riding Drogon is the best moment of this show. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"Blood of My Blood\"",

It later becomes apparent that it is Bran's uncle Benjen Stark; it was assumed that he died long ago but he survived north of the wall and during that time learnt more about the White Walkers. Meanwhile Sam and Gilly arrive at his home; at first they are made to feel welcome but when his father returns the atmosphere turns frosty\u0085 then gets even colder when he learns that Gilly is a Wildling. In King's Landing Jaime and the Tyrell forces move to rescue Queen Margaery but are thwarted when it emerges that King Tommen and Margaery are now siding with High Sparrow. Elsewhere Walder Frey is determined to retake lands lost to 'Blackfish' Tully. Across the Narrow Sea Arya chooses not to kill the actress she was instructed to kill; something that will put her life in danger in the not too distant future. As Daenerys and her Dothraki march to Meereen she is reunited with one of her dragons and gives a stirring speech to her followers.There may not be lots of action in this episode but that doesn't mean it is boring. The opening provides the episode's main action as well a serving to introduce a character we assumed was dead. The scenes at Sam's family home were suitably tense without any real sense of danger; Hannah Murray and John Bradley put in fine performances as Gilly and Sam. The events in King's Landing were intriguing and served to shake things up nicely as the balance of power shifted very suddenly. Arya's scenes were really good; they also mean that her character's development is going to change direction as she deliberately disobeys her instructions. Maisie Williams did a great job playing the role in a way that meant that her move was neither too obvious nor too surprising. We have seen Daenerys give plenty of stirring speeches to various followers over the years but they are still a great way to end an episode; especially when she is sat astride a massive dragon. Overall I really enjoyed this episode and look forward to seeing how things develop.",

                    "content": "To this point, season 6 has had nothing but great episodes. The first 5 episodes had more noteworthy material than perhaps all of season 5, so I guess we were bound to get a bit of slower and more- filler episode. 'Blood of My Blood' certainly had its moments, but I found myself more disappointed with the lack of significant material than anything else.With no Castle Black material with either Jon or Sansa, we began where we left off last week with Bran and Meera desperately trying to get away from the walkers. With Hodor gone, I was wondering who could possibly come to aid if, you know, Meera were to somehow get tired of carrying Bran. None other than Benjen Stark made his triumphant return. Though, he wasn't in the best of shape after an apparent White Walker incident, we'll see just how long he can be of use to them. It's also worth noting that Bran began to process some of the knowledge the Raven gave to him, with moments of the Mad King and several shots of the Night's King.The focus shifted to Sam and Gilly as they came upon House Tarly, which turned out to be a whole lot nicer than I expected. We haven't heard a ton about Sam's family, but the dinner scene just about gave me what I needed to know to understand the family's history. It was no shocker at all that his father picked up on Gilly's Wildling background. But did Sam really expect anything different? It just seems like this visit served no purpose at all, other than to have Sam take Randyll's famous Valyrian Steel sword, Heartsbane.I was most excited about seeing the showdown between the Lannisters/Tyrells and the Faith. Unfortunately, we were robbed of any sort of battles with the reveal that Tommen has aligned himself with the High Sparrow and his followers. I have just become so tired of the High Sparrow's repetitive story arcs. With that said, I am excited to see what Margaery is up to, considering there is no way she is completely on the High Sparrow's side. She had to be playing with Tommen's emotions during that monologue right?This also led to Jaime essentially leaving King's Landing all together. So besides a few great moments with the High Sparrow and a cool horse gallop up the steps of the palace, what was his purpose this season? Hopefully him leaving with Bronn (most likely) will signal for better Jaime story lines.Speaking of leaving, Arya has pretty much cut ties with the House of Black and White. So I once again beg the question, why exactly did we have to spend a season and a half thinking she would become this faceless bada**? I get the parallelism of having her not kill Lady Crane because she is similar to Arya in trying to play someone else for a living, but really? At least, Arya got some pleasure in seeing the fake Joffrey die.We ended with perhaps the best scene of the night as Daenerys rode Drogon and delivered a Braveheart-level speech to the Doth. Could this finally mean the mother of dragons will start making her trek to Kings Landing? In all, the episode lacked in many areas and I felt a gap without Jon Snow or Tyrion, but it was somewhat redeemed by Dany's great speech and Jaime's potential future on the show. With season 6 being virtually unstoppable so far, I guess I can accept a misstep in 'Blood of My Blood'. Let's hope for better things next week.+Dany's speech+Jaime leaves+Bran's visions-Arya cuts ties\u0085so what was the point?-Tarly plot felt anticlimactic-Lannister/Faith showdown was a major letdown6.8/10",

The sets are still great, the new characters are well introduced, especially the family of Samwell, the person who join the Night's Watch in the last five seasons. The scenery is still gorgeous, the editing is really nice, and Ramin Djawadi continues to deliver some fine music.So, overall, not nearly as perfect as the last four episodes, but still great and worth-recommended. :)",

I have to say that in a country where there are monsters, there are people to save them from demons. Someone who can remind you of the old days in one fell swoop. But it should not be forgotten that the monster army is constantly chasing. The main educational point of the episode is that from the old days till now, the upper class people still hate the lower class people. This episode tells me that no man should think less of himself. And it also showed that one should find one's own place as one's own. Not all places are right for everyone. The king may also make the wrong decision, but the problem is who will explain to the king. Did the blind king in love really make the right decision? It's not like an egg in the previous episode, I'll just say the same thing, never miss the last.

While not a lot happened and there was no big death or reveal, it was still a very well put together episode that allowed us to take a bit of a back seat and started to invest us into the remained of the season.What they have done this season which I've loved is continue the character from the previous episode into the first scenes of the next. I think this season they are trying to make a show that if people were going to go an binge it and watch episodes on end, that the season would feel more like a 10 hour movie similar to what Marvel has done with Daredevil and Jessica Jones. That did that again with Bran, continuing him on from the Hodor moment that ended last episode. I've also like how the story arc you see at the start of the episode is usually picked up later in the episode and continues on. I think the way they are planning their episodes and the placement of all the story lines has been great this season.I think my favourite scenes from this episode was with Sam and Gilly and his family. We get to meet yet another king and get to see a family dynamic we haven't really seen in Game of Thrones. We always knew that Sam was disowned by his father but it was great to actually see it. I thought it was a great character development moment with Sam in these scenes alone. At first we saw the timid Sam getting abused by his father but by the end he makes the decision to take Gilly with him and take the sword that is rightfully his. I hope they really explore this story a bit more and I hope this isn't the last we have seen from Papa Sam.I really liked the Ayra scenes in this episode. I always thought she was eventually going to turn her back on the faceless assassin and in this episode she did. I've really liked how the other girl who has been trainer her has been gunning for Ayra this whole time and never believed in her. It is really shown throughout all the training sequences and we finally get to see what it all comes to in the last few episodes. I really liked the play aspect last week and I thought it was fantastic again this week. I like how through the play they were able to create an emotional moment with Ayra. Already this season we have had Sansa and Jon come back together and had the reappearance of Rickon. For me I think they are trying to head towards a Stark reunion and I feel of all the Stark children, Ayra has had one of the biggest journeys since leaving Winterfell.I really loved the ending to this episode. Daenarys story line has fantastically capped off two episode so far this season and I feel like her story is starting to build once again. I was really disappointed with her story last season but its been fantastic seeing her become a conquer again this season. The power she had in this final scene with her dragon was amazing and it really made me excited to see how her story is going to fold out for the remained of the season.8/10",

                    "content": "This episode marks an effort by the show to get two story lines closer to book developments that had been ignored: one by introducing us to Bran's new companion and two, by removing Jaime from King's Landing.In the first case, the appearance of Coldhands/Benjen Stark is welcome. Of course, introducing him 3(?) seasons too late is weird. If anything, the show is forced to reveal his identity immediately because who would remember the guy who appeared for 2 minutes in season 1? His showing up when he did feels a little forced, but in any case is sure to provide some interest in Bran's plot.The King's Landing story on the other hand is a little shaky. The idea of Margaery and Tommen being converted (?) by the High Sparrow is unconvincing, but not without interest. That Jaime is off to Riverrun (under vastly different circumstances and timing than in the book) - to help Walder Frey, who reappears - may move his shambling character forward, but only after he has been used by the show to demolish several other plot lines, from Dorne to, most lamentably, his own. Still no sign of friction between him and Cersei.Arya appears to do what we all knew would happen - reclaim her true identity. Which happens without much being gained, other than wasting a whole lotta time. We now wait to see how she will defeat the other faceless girl who has beaten the crap out of her a gazillion times.Sam's awkward return to the Tarly household was well played. The guy who plays Randyll Tarly has a perfectly disgusted face. Not sure about Sam taking Gilly and stealing Heartsbane though. Kinda defeats the point.And then we have Daenerys. Another - YET another - episode ends with a supposedly epic Daenerys scene. Yet again I felt like throwing up. Yes, that is mostly because I despise her character. But allow me to elaborate on more solid grounds:Theon is Ramsay's prisoner. His badass sister sails around a continent with a band of ironborn cutthroats to save him. They are chased away by a naked Marquis de Sade and a couple of dogs. Daenerys gets captured by a horde of Dothraki. Two swashbucklers infiltrate the city, murder a few guards unnoticed while Her Incompetence murders the Dothraki leaders inside their holy city. Everyone follows her in ecstasy. See a difference? Robb Stark breaks off an engagement. Half his commanders turn on him. All hell breaks loose. Daenerys commits murder and sacrilege. Everyone is happy. Then she rides a dragon she couldn't control and convinces the Dothraki to cross the sea.This is unfair storytelling. Some characters get what's coming to them. Others are unlucky. Others still get a lucky break. Once. And some suffer no (logical) consequences, are saved in bizarre and unlikely ways, never get in trouble for longer than a very little while, and are treated (by other characters) entirely unrealistically, with the sole purpose of being built up as some sort of epic hero (or villain in the case of the even less sensible Ramsay plot line). Well, no. No matter what happens in the future, this is very poor and unbalanced narrative. No one enjoys it when the game is rigged.",

                    "content": "Blood of my Blood is another great episode of the brilliant season 6, but is a slightly lesser achievement that the previous episodes. While it still has its twists and turns, with some great moments thrown in there, however it is, well ... slightly dull in parts.Like episode one, many characters are shoehorned into this episode, and with the absence of Tyrion, this episode does't have much humour. The episode starts off spectacularly, with Bran running into a new ally. This part was very well done, with a fantastic action scene thrown in there.Next we see Sam and Gilly, whom we have not seen in a few weeks. They arrive at his father's castle, and this scene too was very entertaining, but very rushed. The dinner scene that played out was very well done, with Sam's father coming across as very intimidating. But it is all wasted as the scenes feel too rushed and not very important.The part I was really looking forwards to was Jamie and House Tyrell coming to the Queen's rescue, and to confront the High Sparrow. I was a little disappointed. It was, like most of the episode, rushed. While the writing was great here, I wanted more of a confrontation, rather than people dressed up. The biggest complaint about this scene however, was the very obvious green-screen effect in the background. This is very unlike Game of Thrones, as they have such a great budget, but the CGI in this episode was poor.Now this episode is called Blood of my Blood, and it fits this episode perfectly, as it could reference both Bran's story line, or Dany's. And Dany's scenes were, also rushed out. This part was also very disappointing, as not only did nothing really happen, but how come we only saw like 100 Dothraki soldiers? This is another example in why it seems like they did not spend much time on this episode. I am sure there is an explanation for this, like keeping their budget for another ground breaking episode like the one before. We also finally get to see the dragon again, and the CGI on him is dreadful. I was watching it and all I could think was, the dragons looked better in season 2 than here. However this is still a great episode, and it is the weakest out of season 6 so far, but it is also understandable considering the episode that we had before, it was unlikely that they would top that.8.5/10",

Life has devolved, because the F'heads making this crap must have gotten amnesia. Samwell breaks his vowels again the big baby, committing theft punishable by death as he was already sentenced to the wall and some how he can out run them? A dead person made wight from the walkers then dies getting stabbed by the children becomes wight again. The stink coming out of that crap. I could continue with the Holy light coming out of more royal stink-holes pointlessly, as I am sure everybody else was like just do it gump with your stump before you get Freyed adding to their morons. Meanwhile in Braavos death waits for no one sounding like a cracker box completely out of her character, but thank you all for showing us your stage acts. As the acting is literally as bad as the Dothraki on their horses trying to look intelligent for their big second of fame holding up their swords thinking what have we got these in our hands, there isn't even an enemy to chop at. The Dothraki speech in subtitles for its gibberish spoken, defeated the entire point of its appeal. And when different words were subtitled yet the same words are said. D'ohI mean what are we watching? Enjoy your limelight for one second in its glory taking the money, but fracking the crap out of the book and when it will release, because then and finally then the rest of the world will know what fools and what an ...hole you have made.

We had a great episode last week, and this week's episode kind of falls flat. Primarily, because it was acting as a filler episode with no viable progression of storyline. And that is not a bad thing in its own right but on GoT it feels like the showrunners are deliberately stalling matters.That being said, this episode wasn't completely dull. It had its moments - we visit the Tarlys and Benjen Stark is reintroduced as Coldhands. The rest of the episode is forgettable, to say the least. We don't visit most of the places critical to the major story arc - Winterfell, Castle Black, and the Vale.Furthermore, I have had my issues with Dany but she is getting quite unbearable of late. The showrunners are throwing her in every episode, even if she doesn't have any logical storyline to build upon.Conclusively, it feels like Game of Thrones is trying too hard to build suspense where it is not needed, and unduly emphasizing content that has no significant impact on the main storyline. The showrunners should stop treating us as brain-dead fans who can be appeased by one great action scene every other episode. Instead, they should make episodes with substance.",

Great performances all around, and this is shaping up to be one of my favourite seasons in terms of actually gelling and everything feeling balanced from a story telling point of view. Production design is also great, too, although I laughed aloud at the Tully's ridiculous abode. It's frankly completely unexpected within the land that I've seen so far on screen. I could accept it on the continent, with some truly stupendous citadels, but it just comes out of nowhere, so it's a bit of a joke. Still, absolutely lovely once the shock wears off.This said, it's far from my favourite television watching, and I find myself thinking sometimes that for writers there has to be more to drama than simply putting people through the blooming wringer.Hopefully we can get a little more from our TV in the coming years now that Amazon and Netflix are upping everyone's collective game.",

                    "content": "It is beyond my level of comprehension how each episode this season has been praised by the fandom as if this show is flawless. It is very perplexing that the last episode of my once favourite show had actually received a 9.8. I mean, do people actually believe that episode was better than; Ned Starks execution, the battle of Blackwater, the Viper vs the Mountain, Tywin's death and much more? I mean, this whole season wanes in comparison when looking at every other previous season (excluding season 5 of course, which is only slightly better than this one). A user stated last week that reading the reviews on this godforsaken site will put you in a state of trauma, and I'm inclined to agree. And look where that users review is now, flagged down into the last page with every other truthful review. It seems like IMDb has become a site in which truthful and honest reviews are disregarded and flagged down as not helpful all because the GOT fandom can't handle criticism. In previous seasons, people were able to highlight some of the shows shortcomings without fear of being suppressed and censored. Now the fandom disregards the truth and sings the same bs praise each and every other episode. It is appalling. While I do not truly believe the episode is a 1, I have to give it this review to negate a least one positive review and a least bring some semblance of sense to this night's overrated episode. With all that being stated, let me begin on my list of grievances for this night's episode\u0085Speaking in terms of plot progression, nothing significant happened in this episode whatsoever. I mean, the whole point of Sam bringing Gilly to High Heart was so she could stay there while he became a maester. That's what happens in the book at least because he can't take her to the citadel. Instead in this episode Sam takes her to High Heart, only to say no and end up taking her to the Citadel anyways. Please give me a break. Sam's character arc is able to progress just fine without Gilly needing to be a part of it. Also, am I supposed to believe that the biggest coward in the series, Sam, would steal his father's sword Heartsbane? We are talking about Randyll Tarly here. Randyll Tarly would hunt Sam down and gut the POS alive if he even had the audacity to touch his valyrian steel sword. But in the show nope. Sam can apparently steel a rare Valyrian steel sword and leave unscathed.Also, the best part of Tommen in the novels is the fact that he is very young and pretty much incapable of making decisions for himself. As a result, it is up to Cersei to make up the bulk of his decisions which is why the Kings Landing plot is so intriguing in the books. Instead, the show allows Tommen to forge a peace with the High Sparrow. WOW. The same group of people that have been victimizing the Lannister's for season 5 and onwards. Whatever. Then Tommen is apparently bold enough to remove Jaime from Lord Commander of the Kings Guard? Get out of here with that illogical nonsense.In addition to this, Arya's plot just nosedived into absolute nonsense. What was the point in training Arya to become a faceless man for the past 1 season and a \u00bd? I mean, there was absolutely no point in doing this if she was just going to leave the faceless men. And why do it after all of this time? She had multiple opportunities to do so and just now she develops a conscience and decides she can't kill people? Arya is a remorseless killer who has been victimized the entire series. Based on her plot in the novels and what we have seen of her in the shows, she wouldn't hesitate to make a kill for the faceless men, even if that person happened to be innocent. Then we have an absolutely irrelevant and pretentious scene in which Dany flaunts her dragon and makes yet another pretentious speech where she talks about conquering. Of great, as if we didn't have enough of those. And then she states she needs specifically 1000 ships in order to get to Westeros. WOW! Who could have guessed that! Its not like Euron began assembling 100 ships last episode. What a coincidence! D&D obviously don't give their viewership enough credit and think they have to spell everything out for people.The only redeeming parts of the episode was Bran and the reintroduction of Walder Frey. The reintroduction of Walder Frey and sending Jaime to the Riverlands is good as it looks like they are trying to get back in line with what occurs in the novels. Brans storyline was decent as they finally reintroduce Benjen after 6 seasons and we can finally see what is going to occur with him.Like I stated above, while do not believe this episode to be a 1, I have to give it this rating in order to negate one positive review and bring balance to the overrated episode as it is currently sitting at a flawless 10. I understand my reviews are an open invitation to be flagged down as not helpful, so continue to be ignorant towards my reviews fandom. Anyways, I've done enough ranting. Goodbye.",

However, when I sat down with my parents and watched it for a second time, I realised that this episode is much better than I remembered as it executes just about everything it does flawlessly and it really is a perfect example of how Game of Thrones is great at drama as well as violence and fantasy. It dials back on the momentum that previous episodes had and lets its story lines take their time, making it a rather small & self-contained episode that mainly comprises of just three major story lines; Arya's, King's Landing's and Sam's. Also, it perfectly meshes humour & tension with Sam's story-line whilst giving us a few surprises with the King's Landing plot and it sets up an exciting next episode for Arya. We get surprise returns from three characters that have been absent from the show for years, and the episode ends on a spectacular note, reminding us why this show is so special. Overrall, this episode is a neat little gem and while it won't be remembered as one of Thrones' greats, it's still a fantastic episode that effortlessly blends fantasy and drama, whilst also balancing a few twists & turns with setup that makes me eager for the next episode. My score for the episode: 9.6/10.",

                    "content": "When GRRM was plotting the outline of 'The song of Ice and Fire' back in 1993 he mentioned three big threats to Westeros, every threat greater than the previous one.The first threat is the internal civil war among the kingdoms which has subdued but still lingers to this day. The second threat is the conquest of Westeros from the Narrow Sea by Dany and her army along with her dragons. The third is the invasion of Westeros by the White Walkers from beyond the Wall. This episode is significant in the sense that it sets up the second and third threats in a direct collision course. Finally, Danny seems to be all set to sail over the Narrow sea. She has had enough at Essos. We have waited for this moment from the time Kahl Drogo made this announcement back in Season 1. Will Yara provide the ships necessary to set sail?Overall 'Blood of my blood' is a subdued episode compared to the previous one. It once again sets the pieces up for the reminder of the season. Just four more episodes to go. And you have to slow down a little bit to accelerate later to finish the season on a high.We start off where we left things in 'Door'. Bran is still downloading all the stuff. If you pause and see there is too much happening in those few seconds. The one thing that is predictable in GoT is that someone always comes at the right movement to save the day. Be it Brienne saving Sansa a few weeks back to Benjin (Cold Hands) saving Bran now. Benjin's return was predicted by almost all the fans and it's high time all the mysteries get resolved one by one. Is Benjin a hybrid of wight and human? Sam is getting braver day by day. His dad is like Twyin 2.0. His brother chuckling at the idea of White Walkers shows that how much people believe at its existence. It kind of tells that apart from the people who were at Hardhome no one still believes White Walkers are back. In a moment of bravado Sam takes Heart's bane with him. I believe this is a foreshadowing for Sam to learn how to make a Valyrian steel at the old town.Arya's story arc is gaining momentum. It is utterly clear she will never become a no one. A girl still has a list of people to kill. It looks like she knows what she is up to. A showdown between the Waif and Arya is on the cards. That parody of drama shows how much history can be twisted. Nevertheless, Arya enjoyed the death of Jeofery.The showdown at Kings Landing took a U turn. From the time the trailer was released everybody were looking forward to that moment. It was such a disappointment. Margery looked like she knew what was going to happen. She is just abiding her time to save her brother. Tommen is like a ping-pong ball going back and forth between his mother and High Sparrow. This entire season the story at Kings Landing is going at snail's pace. Walder Frey is back after the infamous Red Wedding. He looks lot healthier than he used to be? Now Jamie coming to his cause we can expect a showdown between Jamie and Brienne at the Riverrun. The duo hold the twin Valyrian swords made from Ned's Ice. Now back across the Narrow sea, Dany is all set to sail. The speech she gave was a bit tedious. However, her dragon Drogon looks impressive. All the story arc looks all set to converge now. I kind of have a feeling it will all end where it began \u2013 back at Winterfell.+ Benjin is back+ Bran downloads history + Sam's bravado + Cunning High SparrowA bit slow-pacedConspicuous absence of Tyrion and Jon Snow",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.\"The Broken Man\" may not quite be one of the best 'Game of Thrones' episodes. As far as Season 6 episodes go, it's not quite up there with \"Home\", \"Book of the Stranger\" and \"The Door\". That is in no way a knock because it is still a great episode that has almost everything that makes 'Game of Thrones' such a favourite. It doesn't matter that \"The Broken Man\" is not the most action-packed episode, that there aren't the big moments quite on the same level as other episodes and that it doesn't have as many bold revelations. What \"The Broken Man\" does brilliantly is the characterisation and development. One of the best episodes of Season 6 in this regard, plentiful and very rich, never less than interesting. It is one of those setting up episodes and putting things into place, again doing a great job with that and in a way that forwards momentum and like things are leading somewhere. It also does better than the previous Season 6 episodes for me actually in feeling the most like the first two seasons and like the show had gone back to its roots, possibly too the best Season 6 in general got in achieving this. No knocking here, just really liked that there was a return to this story approach. Did feel that Arya's scenes were a little rushed and didn't fit as comfortably as the rest of the more relevant and bigger events did, her biggest moment (her attack) is shocking though. Other than that, there are standout elements in the story and characters. In particular Sandor's return, the introduction of Lyanna, Blackfish (an awesome character), Jaime and Blackfish's interaction and the Riverrun siege. Have no issue with the performances with not a bad performance in the bunch, with the introductory and returning characters making just as much an impression as the regulars. Rory McCann is pretty scintillating, as is Clive Russell with some of the episode's best lines.Visually, \"The Broken Man\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"The Broken Man\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The end scoring is especially powerful. Plenty of layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing, loved that for Blackfish.In summary, great episode. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

His scenes are handled with sensitivity and depth, featuring a great one-episode guest turn from no less than Ian McShane, although I wanted more. Do we really need to spend all that time with Yara and Theon in the brothel? It smacks of excess. Elsewhere, Arya's storyline moves on suddenly but has taken so long in earlier drawn-out scenes that it feels rushed now; the introduction of fan-favourite Lyanna is excellent, and the scenes involving the siege at Riverrun offer a bit of the military stuff we haven't seen for a while.",

The good have little advantage over the bad and must fight like crazy to stay on their feet. We get to see where several characters are at as the battle awaits. Sansa is with John, trying to raise and army to confront the Boltons. Arya has turned away from the face changers and begins to seek out a plan (but, then, who are her friends?). She is attacked by them. Theon is with his sister, who challenges his manhood, and we can see him acquiesce. Jaime Lannister is now leading forces for Cersei and must confront a stubborn man who has been harmed irreparably in the past and isn't about to join forces with a family he despises. Margery is now lying in the weeds. We know she is up to something. Her feckless little boy husband (what a little snot!) want her to spend more time with him. There is even more, but others have already addressed these things. I'll just say that this was one of the best episode.",

A peace that isn't destined to last long. Further north Jon, Sansa and Ser Davos are trying to persuade the northern families that were loyal to the Starks to support them in their upcoming battle to retake Winterfell; they aren't as successful as they would hope. In King's Landing Queen Margaery cautions her mother to leave the city; suggesting that her conversion to the fanatical views of High Sparrow might not be as real as it first seemed. In Braavos Arya is planning to return to Winterfell but before she can leave she is attacked by The Waif. We also have the arrival of Jaime Lannister at the Siege of Riverrun.This was another fine episode which provided a couple of genuinely surprising moments as well as an unexpected laugh. The main surprise was the revelation that Sandor Clegane wasn't dead; it will be interesting to see what happens next for this character. The other surprise was the fight between Arya and The Waif; not that it took place but that Arya appeared to be seriously injured afterwards. The humour was provided in a delightful scene where Lyanna Mormont is petitioned to assist in the retaking of Winterfell when, after much debate, agrees and it is revealed that she has a force of sixty eight men! Young Bella Ramsey did a great job in the role of Lyanna. There isn't much in the way of action; much of what we see is clearly positioning for what is to come. Thankfully none of it was boring though it just served to make me keen to see what happens next.",

                    "content": "Ah, the joy of seeing a fan favorite character return never fails to lift my spirits. The return of 'The Hound' has been heavily rumored for a while now, and the 'The Broken Man' title seemed like the perfect time to bring him back. Fortunately, The Hound wasn't the only great thing about this episode as it was a strong return to the greatness that has been this season of Game of Thrones.So it turns out Ian McShane's role this season was indeed a one-off as the acting legend was the man responsible for saving Sandor The Hound Clegane after his misstep with Brienne at the end of season 4. As different of a man as was attempting to be with the village, it sure seems like he will return to his killing ways the next time we see him as every single one of the people he was living with are now dead at the hands of the brotherhood.More fun interactions came from the Queen of Thorns this week as she tried to bargain with Margaery. I think we all knew Margaery was playing Tommen and the High Sparrow, but slipping her grandmother the picture of the rose seems like the final clue we need. She is out for revenge and I can only hope revenge is what she will get. No one wants the High Sparrow gone more than me.Olenna Tyrell also got to sass her way out of the conversation with Cersei and basically blame everything bad that has happened in Kings Landing on her. Can we really disagree with Olenna? Cersei is at the brunt of the entire 'Faith' problem. It will be interesting to see just how she sneaks her way out of this one. If the fans had it their way, the trial by combat for Cersei's freedom would involve both Clegane's, so The Hound would have to move pretty fast to Kings Landing.Some more sass came from the debut of Lyanna Mormont and boy was it entertaining. Of course, we all want to see Sansa and Jon rally all of the North against the Bolton's, but having a young girl be one of their toughest obstacles was a pleasantly surprising route to go. As much as Jon and Sansa tried to play the family card with her, Lyanna wasn't budging. Luckily, Daavos came in for the save. With the 'Battle of the Bastards' just two episodes away, the Starks are going to have to come up with a few more lucky tricks up their sleeve.It had been a while since we had seen the Tully's or the Frey's in the show, so last week's tease didn't really get me excited for Jaime's trip to see Blackfish this week. With that said, the King- slayer's scene with Blackfish was a marvel to watch. One-up after one-up between the two ended with Blackfish having the slight upper- hand although I can't see it ending anything other way but death in battle. On a side note, how great was it seeing Bronn back? Even if it was for just for a few quips. Last but not least we got to see a few scenes in Braavos with Arya. Sadly, her planned trip 'home' isn't look like it's going to happen too soon with Waif nearly stabbing her to death. I don't know who can possibly come and save her but perhaps Lady Crane can help return the favor after what Arya did for her last week. Either way, it sure seems like every storyline is coming to a breaking point, which is exciting. Even with Yara and Theon, who got a small scene this week, they seem set on sailing to Meereen to help Daenerys, which would set up great things to come in season 7. Overall, a great episode with new and old characters shining and setting up what's to come in the final 3 episodes this season. +The fricking Hound+Queen of Thorns +Margaery scheming+Lyanna Mormont+The North is reminded+Bloody Braavos sequence-Still not entirely sure about this Blackfish situation9.0/10",

He's trying to find redemption by living peacefully with the villagers only to seek vengeance after finding his happiness taken away from him. Rory McCann, who played the Hound, also known as Sandor Clegane in the first four seasons, gives a really solid performance. Ian McShane, who plays Ray, the man who nursed him back to health, is a great addition to the show's sixth season and gives a superb performance as a peaceful man who helps the Hound find his happiness.That being said, everything else is great. Some of the story lines from the previous episodes have been advanced with Arya trying to get back home after she stopped Lady Crane from drinking her poisoned rum and decided not to become a faceless person, unaware that something terrible would happen to her. The performances are still solid, the pacing is very brisk, Mark Mylod, who directed the third and fourth episodes of Season 5, does a great job directing, the editing is really smooth, the scenery, sets, and costumes are still lavish, and Ramin Djawadi continues to deliver some perfect moments in his score.So, overall, The Broken Man succeeds in it's character-driven story for the Hound for the sixth season and sets up nicely to what's going to happen in the last three episodes. Thumbs up. :)",

Because we got the god damn Hound back! Since Arya 'killed' him, I always thought he would return. In this day and age of TV and movies, no one is truly dead unless you see a body and a funeral.From then on the episode continued to role on strong. While this wasn't a big bang episode where everything happens and a million people die, it was an amazing Game of Thrones episode. What makes me really enjoy a series is when an episode can take a back seat and just lets the plot play out without anything major happening. For most people, they are called filler episodes, and to a point they are. But it's when these filler episodes are executed so fantastically and build up the story for the final few episodes that it really makes me love the show. I really loved everything with Jon and Sansa this episode. I thought the chemistry in negotiation with Jon, Sansa and Davos was so strong and at that point they probably could convince me to do anything. I thought the little girl was fantastic.I know we are starting to get to the back end of the series but I really hope she's a character we get to see more of in the next couple of years.All the scenes at Kings Landing were great as well. This is really the first time we get to see the High Sparrow have control over the city. With him controlling Tommen and Margery, he becomes one of the most powerful characters in the show. What I really liked about these scenes is how they show that the High Sparrow wants the bigger fish. He tries to use Margery to get her grandmother on board with the High Sparrows plans. Over this season I've really loved the High Sparrow. He is the same sort of character we have Little Finger where he is a manipulator and gets his power through other people.Something I thought was really smart this episode was the contrast between Arya and the Hound. As the Hound reappears, alive and healthy, we get to see what the Faceless Assassin has for Arya. As soon as I saw the old lady I knew something was going to happen, and when she first started getting stabbed, I thought it was going to be the end of Arya. I don't think she will die on the bases that her story only really features her, and to kill her would to completely remove that story. While the Red Wedding in many ways ended the storyline had by Rob and Catylin, it produced flow on effects that we are still seeing today.Overall a really great episode. I really like how they are building to the end of the season and with 3 episodes left, I think we are in for a big one.",

First we get Jon Snow and Sansa visiting the northern houses to gather support. Well. They go to Bear Island, Deepwood Motte, and the context implies a couple more places. Gathering precious few troops. Now, it's true, the little girl playing Lyanna Mormont does steal the show, and the scene with the Glovers was also good. Buuuuuuuut....if you happen to take a look at the map, you'll note it should have taken them quite some time to go around all these places - even if it was implied time (like, months) did pass, they wasted it all visiting lesser houses, instead of going directly to Lord Manderly, the guy who actually has the means to help.

This builds up epic battles which will be taking place in the next few episodes and the tension here is spectacular. Without any spoilers, this episode starts of brilliantly, with an arrival of someone that made me smile from ear to ear. The Jon and Sansa's storyline was also very good here, as it will pay off when the big battle arrives. The scenes at Kings Lander were not all that important, with some good lines thrown in there, but little happening, but still enough to hold your interest.The Arya scenes were very well done, but very rushed. All of the episodes this season have been way too short, and there feels like they could have had time for some more scenes. However the best part about this episode is its build up, every character we see if thrown in a cliffhanger of sorts. Also the production this episode was outstanding, the sets the beautiful landscapes and new regions we have never seen before, were done so well. This is a slow episode but it is by far not boring, it was like the older episodes that built up tension that will pay off soon. 9/10",

Cersei's must be much better, because she hates you even more, but Olena's daughter is the queen spy, and now sticking the tongue out and blowing for the full effect, pffftttt pfftttttt and pffftttt, Margaery left a rose on it. A bunch of stupid hot air that hasn't gone anywhere except offering stupidity, we have waited for years and still we get the same crap out of Kings Landing. That is not how to do a siege when sieging is done, nanana pfffttt nanana, music and drum roll, the catapults still aren't firing yet, and I doubt they ever will because Jamie is useless. Although they take 62 men for every veteran 10 year old, so they don't Shireen, gaining Davos recruitment, painted in the CGI tranquility of waterfalls and hummingbirds for the much bigger CGI castle needed to paint all of Bear Hall's 62 men. Although Sansa will be much happier when getting umbered and glovered with just a few more Wildlings. What happened when Theon lost his knob, it makes lesbians.If I have to review this like a normal person, because there is false censorship on an 18 keyword 18 show where Muppet's, as who knows what they are, are paid to have their strings pulled, pretending to be other Muppet's that don't exist, but they only want to have a Muppet's 10 out of 10 rating. So you will say it is a 10 out of 10, or all the Muppet's watching this having their strings pulled by its Muppet's will exterminate your reviews, because it only took three whole words to sum up this episode; This show stinks. There is obviously some problems with free speech and what Muppet's finding entertaining.This show's demographic is for zit pocked teenagers playing computer games, told through the countless ridiculous child acts who have found an 18 stash, or a bunch of girls as most acts are offering them some kind of messianic superpowers and empowerment, and they survive longer than anybody else when the blokes are mostly psycho's, or it's for a bunch of in-breeds and hicks, those employees used in manipulating its cheese, trying to turn a profit out of the next computer game. There isn't anything else in this show, if they didn't use their backgrounds there would be absolutely nothing in it at all. A show that is so up its own butt, manipulating, and exaggerating its own ratings. It is a pizza of the week. I agree it has a few toppings when the odd 1 or 2 episodes in a season hit their mark, the other 8 every season are mostly offering us their mediocre drivel, and you wouldn't miss out anything by missing them. It definitely and 100% doesn't make this show a 10 out of 10. Anybody else can name 10 better shows in this genre, shows that didn't have to pretend to be anything else by manipulating their success. Its money spent doesn't make this show great, sink-holes manipulating social media's peer pressure doesn't make this show great. Its money spent meant it has changed its scenes every 3 minutes wasting money. Couldn't it have just told the broken pillars story this episode, no they had to pay everybody everywhere else, resulting in it constantly airing weak episodes containing absurd flaws and a total lack of coherence to any shown story. Except through a story told by it changing scenes means everybody randomly appears everywhere and they have forgotten what they did in the last scene shown. It changing scenes makes little to no action in those 3 odd minutes aired. Don't get me started on the script made for this demographic, and it has to introduce everyone every time they speak so they remember who they are through the constantly changing scenes further reminding everyone of their authority and status held, than they load the rest of the speech with obscenity, because it has very little action so it uses porn to entice all of its teen aged demographic.",

I am VERY satisfied with where his (The Hound) arc has taken him so far, and I hope they show his act of retribution. I do hope that he eventually hooks up with Arya, and they rain blood on the realm. Cersei last, please. I liked Lady Tyrell's parting words to her.I do not know how Arya is going to survive a gut-wound like that, but she has to live. There was a quick glimpse of the next episode, and a fight with the Waif, so I'm guessing she'll find some Quik- Clot or something. I am curious how she is going to settle up with the assassin's guild. She can't evade them forever, even in the West.I am not thrilled with Sansa (now, or ever), and her campaign for war. She is not going to DO anything in battle, so it feels out of her place to see her champing at the bit to send men off to die in her name. It was great to hear her told 'no', and I thought the Mormont exchange was brilliant.Finally, Yara is my new favorite. And Theon needs to suck it up. Just because he can't partake doesn't mean his rain cloud needs to sour the mood of the crew. Get drunk, play tiddly-winks, or whatever. Do ANYTHING but ... cock-block. ... Too soon?All in all, I thought it was a great episode. Not a lot of action, per se, but a lot of moving of major parts for the battle royales to comes.Ha ha ha! 62 spears ... Bloody marvelous!",

Because it indeed damages its quality when this nonsense gets stuck in the heads of the economic maestros. Not only is unnecessary but also detrimental.This season has been generally like that with its ups and downs being the best of it plainly average because it gets banal when compared with other existent series made to be watched and thrown in the recycle bin.But this episode stroke me with a exhalation of hope. Truly... (or is it just me hungering for old GOT's primordial quality?) It proved me that the artistic sense of representation, an excellent script, the great dramatizations of great actors leaded by great directors orchestrating great \"musicians\" surpasses by far the hysteric need of special effects or everything having to be \"BIG\". Of course special effects are welcome, but they shouldn't be at the top of the pyramid of priorities. They are extras.Anyway, trash with that big. Big were the majestic dramatizations of Liam Cunningham (Ser Davos), Clive Russell (Brynden 'Blackfish' Tully), Diana Rigg (Olenna Tyrell) and most specially, the incredible Bella Ramsey (Lyanna Mormont). With honourable mentions to Natalie Dormer (Margaery Tyrell), Rory McCann, Ian McShane (Brother Ray) and Tim McInnerny (Robett Glover).And also BIG were the photography, the wardrobe, the landscapes, the characters developments, this episode.",

However, this episode I have actually found to be one of the best ones this season and I'll tell you why.The siege of Riverrun was really well done. I find D&D shine best when adapting book content and putting it into visuals, which is why this scene panned out so well. This scene pretty much exactly how I envisioned it while reading the books. The guy who plays the Black fish does an excellent job portraying him. The dialogue b/w the Blackfish and Jaime was really well done. Overall, a really good scene.The reintroduction of the hound was great, although not much of a surprise knowing about the gravedigger theory. I am quite curious to see where his arc is going. Many believe he is going to extract his vengeance on Gregor Clegane (his brother the Mountain), but this episode shows that it looks like he is going to get vengeance on the Brotherhood without Banners which is quite surprising.I also really liked Jon and Sansa going to gather northern support. My favourite parts in the book ADWD was when Stannis was trying to garner support from all of the Northern houses, and it was nice to see this pan out on screen although it was with Jon and Sansa.Also it was a huge relief that I didn't have to see Dany or Tyrion and all of Essos for an episode. I find that plot has been stagnating for quite some time and it was a relief that they ignored it this episode. Also, not having to see Ramsey with his plot armour for the past few episodes has been quite a relief as well.With all of the positives being stated, I do have some grievances. I don't really understand the point of them introducing Euron. Euron in the books is great but his show counterpart doesn't seem to really have a purpose. It seems like Dany will end up just taking the side of Asha/Yara and Theon, and stealing all of Euron's ships. Perhaps I'm speaking to soon, but it just seems like they will use him as a plot device to get Dany over to Westeros and nothing else and then Dany will backstab him. Or maybe he will serve some larger purpose in the show. I guess we'll see. While I don't really know if I think this is a 10, that's just how I write my reviews. If I like something, it gets a 10. If I don't like something, it gets a 1. Anyways, thanks for your time.",

Was he sleeping? Drinking? I must know!A good episode does not have to hold a scene of a battle, just some really good writing and acting will do fine, unless they can repeat the quality of Hardhome.Obligatory death scenes. Getting really annoying though, this episode it was Ian McShane, maybe JRR himself should make a death scene cameo, many people would be pleased.Some characters are too good to complain that people in GoT are coming back too frequently after they die. Bold but clever.Castle sieges! Finally we're talking medieval. But this particular was uneventful. As much as I dislike deus ex machina a dragon would fit nicely into a castle siege. Here's hoping.Not all child leaders are idiots or otherwise cringe-worthy.I wish I could've expressed myself more eloquently, but all I really wanted to say is that it is the characters, the lore, the \"daily stuff\", the not so simple stories of the simple folk that make the story come alive. We've witnessed a story of a small group of people who tried to live peacefully out of harm's way, but they failed, because that was the lesson, it is pointless to search for a healthy spot on a diseased body.This was a great episode because it brought me back to the main plot of the story, back to the real, away from the banal desire to see who will sit on the rusty throne, but to raise a question \"How the hell can anyone live in this place?\"",

This season really is amazing (thus far)and this episode is probably the second best, right behind \"The Door\". It really tries new things and kind of breaks the fold when it comes to the structure of a Thrones episode as it really is focused on one character, who has returned after 2 years of being presumably dead, and his arc throughout the episode; trying to adjust to a life without murder, but then ultimately being sucked back into that world in a tragic ending. We get a surprise guest appearance from Ian McShane who, of course, gives a fantastic performance and really makes you care for his character in just mere minutes of screen time, making the unfortunate twist at the end of the episode all the more sadder. Of course, there are other surprises and plot advances, which only bolster the episode, but I'd just like to mention the Riverrun plot line, which featured a great scene between Jaime and the Blackfish, and the return of the beloved Bronn. It's great to see Jaime becoming the man Tywin wanted him to be and getting his family and their house back together ever since his daughter died in his arms back in Season 5, which has clearly changed him, for better or worse. Unfortunately, Tyrion is absent for a second episode in a row, which is fine because if there's no story to tell, then just checking up on him would purely be filler, but I always miss him and Varys's banter. The only flaw with this episode is what it doesn't have, but it doesn't really need it either. Therefore: I'm going to give this episode a 9.7/10.",

And of course, this was how things used to be back during the initial seasons when they didn't have sky rocketing production budgets. We rarely get a scene before the opening credits and today's opening scene surprised me and it was totally worth it. Each log of wood is being carried by at least three men and there is this guy carrying a huge log of wood all by himself. Who else could it be other than the Hound. He is the REVENANT. Ian McShane's cameo was perfect as a Septon. His discussions with the Hound, showing him the ways of the pacifist and asking him to explore the reason for living is all but foreshadowing for the Cleganebowl. It's been two years since the hound has been saved, for all we know he might be nearer to Kings Landing than we expect and another Septon might find him at the right time. For the first time this season Kings Landing story arc is refreshingly good. Margaery has learnt a great deal about deception from her grandmother. She is playing the High-Septon like a violin. That rose she gives her grandma is to show her she is still Margaery of House Tyrell behind this facade. Cersei is going out and out in the path of violence like a cascading snow ball. Too bad neither Tyrion nor Tywin is around to control her. It is time for things to come crashing down. Lady Lyanna Mormont steals the show during the recruiting spree. She is so adorable. She reminds of the time 10-year-old Bran was heading Winterfell in the absence of his brother. Even though as expected the wildlings support Snow most of the Northern houses remember the Starks for all the wrong reasons. Out of desperation Sansa writes a letter. Is it to Littlefinger?Blackfish is a total bad ass. He is my new favourite character in the show. His confrontation with Jamie was an awesome scene. When Brienne reaches him next week what will his move be? Wil he hold the castle or fight for the Starks?Moving on to Volantis, Theon hasn't moved on from his castration. It was kind of comical to see him in a brothel. Anyway when he reaches Meeren he will have a lot of company. For the first time we get to know the sexual preference of his sister. Who knows what will happen when she meets Daenerys. It looks like Arya's plot lacks some logic. The Waif is supposed to be a seasoned professional assassin and how did she let Arya escape? And where was Arya's needle when she most needed it. She was supposed to be on guard for attack from the Waif and yet she was not. Wait, unless.. unless.. the new theory about Arya is totally true. Can the Waif really be a figment of Arya's imagination like Brad Pitt from the Fight Club? Even though I'm not buying this theory we have to wait till next episode to get the answers. The writers of GoT usually don't miss their logic.+ Solid episode reminiscent of earlier seasons+ Adorable little Lady Mormont+ Badass BlackfishAnother conspicuous absence of Tyrion.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.So it is paining me to actually a less than positive review to express my disappointment in \"No One\". This is not going to be a popular opinion, but for me \"No One\" was the first big disappointment of 'Game of Thrones'. Saying this because there are some controversial previous episodes and quite a few fans didn't like Season 5 in general. To me, the previous episodes ranged from good to special. Wouldn't say from personal opinion that \"No One\" is a terrible episode, but it is not a representation of what made me a fan of the show and do agree with many of the criticisms. Will start off with the good things. Visually, \"No One\" looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot talk about \"No One\" without mentioning the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. Have no qualms with the acting, which all round is spot on with no exceptions regardless of the character writing and such. Wonderful to see Peter Dinklage again and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau does give some of his best acting here. A few of the story and script elements are done well. Tyrion's scene with Missandrei and Grey Worm is a highlight, while of the storylines the King's Landing (Cersei is awesome here!) and the Brotherhood Without Banners re-introduction come off best. Love Bronn, a great job was done with Jaime and did enjoy him with Brienne. A few nice lines.However, there are also major drawbacks. Do have to agree that Arya's storyline brings down \"No One\" significantly. Anti-climactic, contrived and implausible with an out of character Arya (even when taking into account the defence the story has gotten), it was a mess. Was mixed on the Riverrun scenes. Love Jaime and there are some gritty, intense and emotional parts. The storyline just felt too rushed and resolved too easily. And sorry, Blackfish deserved much better treatment than he got here. For me, too much of \"No One\" felt on the rushed side and it all felt too tidy and pat. Other episodes do a far better job progressing the characters and subplots (Jaime comes closest here), some people may argue that this is one of those setting up and putting things into place episodes, but \"The Broken Man\" did that much better while still moving things forward. And please make Tommen and Edmure more interesting, there is not enough to them yet to pass as \"love to hate\" etc. characters yet.Overall, a disappointment while still being watchable. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

Arya's storyline is finally, thank goodness, tied up, going on a season too long as it did and wasting a character who was one of the best in the show back in season two. The chase scene involving her and the Waif isn't great, but at least it finishes all that disastrous play stuff. Elsewhere, we finally get to see the Mountain in action and it doesn't disappoint, while it's a return to form for the Hound. Best of all are the political wranglings at the siege of Riverrun, with the honourable Blackfish reminding me of Ned Stark and his end; a nice bit of writing, that.",

We have never seen her as supernatural, but in a Wile E Coyote kind of way, she keeps bouncing back, even though she has been brutally stabbed. Her wounds should have been utterly debilitating but she swims, runs, goes on the offensive. Even in the most dramatic fantasy, there have to be rules. Aside from her story, the rest is pretty good development of times and plot lines, more exposition. There is some nice revenge stuff. Cersei is becoming more and more interesting, even though she is ultimately ruthless. The forces are up for alliances or forced compliance, and so going into the ninth of the season, I have great interest. Tyrion at times gets a little tiresome with his indulgences. He seems so focused on being drunk all the time. But he still manages to function well. Dani is out there and things are going to get hot, literally. Not the best of episodes but a necessary one.",

When Arya wakes up, she finds that the Waif has just killed Lady Crane and wants to kill her. Arya flees and is hunted down by the Waif. In Riverlands, Clegane seeks revenge and hunts down the men from the Brotherhood without Banners that killed the settlers; he stumbles upon Beric that invites him to join his group. In Meereen, life seems to be normal; however the Masters send vessels to attack the city. In King's Landing, Cersei challenges the Faith Militant and Gregor defends her killing one fanatic that has attacked him. Out of the blue, King Tommen announces a surprising decision that affects his mother and Loras. Brienne unsuccessfully tries to convince Blackfish to surrender his castle to Jaime. But Jaime makes a deal with Edmure that is released, returns to the castle and surrenders it to Jaime. \"No One\" is an episode where Arya ends her pointless journey in Braavos. She has spent half season to join the criminal Jaqen and now she gives up. The poor Lady Crane dies for helping Arya. In Meereen, Daenerys returns in the moment that the city is under attack of the Masters. The Machievellian Jaime retakes Riverrun without bloodshed. The announcement of King Tommen is surprising and the consequences will certainly be bloody. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): \"No One\"",

Arya must now flee through the city and retrieve her sword 'Needle' before facing The Waif in combat one last time. Elsewhere it becomes clear that Sandor Clegane has definitely not forsaken violence as he brutally dispatched those responsible for the massacre of the previous episode. Brianne arrives at Riverrun and persuades Jaime Lannister to let her talk to Blackfish Tully in order to persuade him to abandon his position and head north to join the fight to retake Winterfell for Sansa Stark. He refuses but Jaime comes up with another way to try to take Riverrun. In King's Landing the King makes an announcement that significantly weakens his mother's position and in Meereen the slavers go back on their agreement with Tyrion and attack the city.I was surprised to see just how unpopular this episode is with some reviewers as I really enjoyed it\u0085 especially the parts others seemed to dislike most. I really enjoyed Arya's story line; for too long she was just training and generally having a bad time; things may reach a low point for her here as she is wounded then the person who is caring for her is killed but it leads to her fighting back and, in a scene I really liked, proudly reclaiming her name. Maisie Williams does a fine job in the role, which is why she has been one of my favourite characters from early on in the series. The other scenes were pretty good too; the Clegane brothers, 'The Hound' and 'The Mountain', each provide some brutal action of the sort we haven't seen for a while. The events in Riverrun provided some interesting twists as well as the unfortunate loss of an interesting character\u0085 slightly disappointingly this was off screen. The attack on Meereen was fairly impressive and sets things up nicely for a battle that is sure to come; the timing of Daenerys's return to Meereen might be a bit convenient but adds to the dramatic effect. Overall I thought this was a really fine episode but I won't say 'fans of the show are sure to enjoy it' as clearly some don't.",

                    "content": "With two episodes left, Game of Thrones is in full throttle as many plots have to be tied up by seasons end. 'No One' wasn't necessarily the great episode I had hoped; it was no slacker either. Much like the last few weeks, it contained several great moments, but quite a few frustrating ones as well.Beginning with the Arya cliffhanger from last week, it turns out Lady Crane was indeed the one to help her with her wounds. I think it was safe to assume Arya wasn't going to die, but having Waif nearly kill her added some suspense. Although it was very disappointing we didn't get to see any fight between the two. Really? All those crazy/horrible Waif running scenes for nothing? With that said, I'm glad this part of the Arya Stark saga is over. But where will she actually go? Onto Arya's old road trip partner, The Hound. After last week's not-so-shocking-but-still-awesome-reveal, I was anxious for some more Rory McCann and boy did we get just that. Even though we barely got to know the crew The Hound was chilling with, it was satisfying to see him slice through every last piece of them. These killings then led him to the rest of the Brotherhood Without Banners, where we found Thoros of Myr and Beric Dondarrion. I'm not sure how exactly The Hound's inclusion to the Brotherhood factors into the larger scope of things, but I'm excited.One can never have enough Clegane action and we double the dose of it tonight as The Mountain got to show his strength once again. Having him back up Cersei makes her even more terrifying than she's ever been and that was on display tonight for sure. Unfortunately, according to King Tommen, trial by combat will no longer be allowed. Disappointing for people who were somehow hoping for a Cleganebowl. The central conflict of the episode came at Riverrun where Jaime and Brienne met once more. With Jaime a far more likable character than he began, it's hard to really decide who to root for in this situation. It's refreshing to see such a well-realized non-sexual relationship on an incredibly dark show like Game of Thrones. Luckily, the conflict ended up being moot point as Edmure took back the castle and surrendered it to the Lannisters without Blackfish. Again, it was disappointing to not see Blackfish' final battle. No matter, my favorite scenes came from Riverrun anyway. Bronn and Podrick? That was gold.Lastly, Tyrion made his welcomed return this week cracking even more jokes than before. It's really unfortunate, however, how poorly his political decisions have turned out this season. Having Meereen under attack by The Masters and needing Dany and Dragons to swoop in and save the city was cool, but I sure hope Tyrion learns something from all of the chaos. Speaking of politics, Varys is making his way back to Westeros to 'gather friends'. Who could they possibly be?So this episode didn't have a big WTF like last years' 8th episode, Hardhome, but it had some fantastic one v one banter between beloved characters and a resolution to the frustrating 'no one' situation. 2 more episodes. Yikes.+Jaime and Brienne+Bronn & Pod+Dany returns+Arya leaves+Cleganes go on a killing spree-Missed a few big death scenes; Waif and Blackfish7.8/10",

Here Jaymie is trying to take it from Blackfish but Blackfish is refusing to stand down, even after Brienne gives him and opportunity to help his family. So what does Jaymi decide to do. He decides to send in his prisoner, who is the rightful king of Riverrun and gets him to go clear the place out. While I get that he wasn't always Jaymie's prisoner and all that, the fact that he was the prisoner all episode, even when Brienne goes into Riverrun, and they only decided to send him in at the end. For me it was just a sloppy writing moment where I think they had this grand plan of a fight but had to be dealt with quickly with the events coming in the next couple of weeks.Apart from that though this episode was the typical Game of Thrones amazing. I thought yet again they wrote Tyrion and all his supporting characters fantastically. The whole sequence with the jokes and wine was hilarious. I feel that what they have done this season is taken the characteristics of Tyrion we all like and started to spread them to his supporting characters which I think is a really smart move.The Hound story line was again great. I feel like it's been a while since we had a slightly comedic slaughtering and we got 2 great ones this episode. The best one was from the Hound with the axe, the second being his brother, the Mountain, killing one of the High Sparrow's men. I'm really looking forward to seeing the Hound back into the frame and playing a big part in the back end of the series. I can see another Ayra/Hound team up coming and it's going to be awesome.Speaking of Ayra, her faceless assassin arc has now officially ended. I really loved what they did with her being chased through the city all the way to her cave, before ending it in the darkness. What I thought was really smart about this was it represents how much Ayra has changed and learnt during her time there. At the end of last season you would never think she would be able to fight blind but now she can. While that isn't the best skill in the world to have, it was there purely as a way to show how she has evolved as a character. The girl has a name and it is Ayra Stark of Winterfell.Something not many of us saw coming was Tommen's announcement that there would be no more trial by combat. As an audience we were all waiting for that moment that zombie Mountain was pitched up against the Hound for what could of been one of the most brutal combats we have seen since the Mountain went full pimple popper on Oberyn. While it's a disappointment, I think that in recent episodes that the story arc being played out at Kings Landing has been really solid and I'm interested to see what twists it shows up in the last few weeks.Apart from a sequence that gave me the blood boils, it was a pretty great episode like always for Game of Thrones. I thought in many ways this episode was tying the knots of a few story arcs so that we could bring our focus towards the big ending. Episode 9 is next week and we all know that chances are, this could be one of the best episodes of TV we have ever seen.8/10",

                    "content": "I have often commented on, and complained about, the simple fact that when the show stopped relying on GRRM's plot lines, lots of the characters' decision stopped making any sense, while events started unfolding in bizarre, unrealistic, and sometimes just plainly silly manner.And this episode is the apotheosis of that symptom. With the exception of the scenes involving Sandor Clegane's meeting with the Brotherhood without Banners, which was really good, and the ones in King's Landing, where Cersei first rejoices at Undead Gregor's skill in shielding her only to get another cold shower when her son outlaws trial by combat, nothing else in the episode makes much sense:Let's begin with Riverrun. Brienne has arrived (carrying over from the previous episode, distances and times are apparently no longer something anyone writing the script cares about) and convinces Jaime to give her a chance to convince Blackfish to leave the castle and follow her to Winterfell - now, previously, Jon Snow, after touring half the North in half a day, said he couldn't wait, but my guess is Brienne's journey across the continent and back again won't prevent her from joining the siege. It doesn't seem to take more than a couple of days. Well, unless you are Sam. I doubt he's gonna reach Oldtown in this season. He must be stuck in some temporal loop. But I'm getting carried away. After Brienne fails to convince Brynden, Jaime conjures the most idiotic plan conceived in the show, which relies on Edmure being an idiot, in addition to the vast majority of the Riverrun defenders also being morons. Suffice to say, it works. The Blackfish decides, for no half-good reason, to die. But after this comedy of a siege, we don't even get to see him fight. Brienne then leaves, and apparently doesn't care about Jaime not-quite-being-true to his promise.Meanwhile, Arya is found by Waif. And this time, all that I was pleased hadn't happened in the previous episode hits the fan. Arya has been stabbed many times in the groin. OK, she survives, it's not that weird - although she was stabbed by a skilled assassin. What is weird is how she can suddenly go into parkour mode, run, jump, fall, her guts not spilling, and then defeats her enemy. Because...she turned off the light? OK, I get it, but you'd think all that training Arya failed at? Wouldn't Waif have also passed through it? Like, successfully? And then Jaqen of course lets her go, because, well, who knows. Oh, we don't see this fight either. But OK, this was done in darkness. Let's say it's reasonable.Meanwhile in Meereen, no one has noticed that a huge fleet is approaching until the ships -LITERALLY- start bombarding the city. Thanks, greatest spy network in the world. Of course, it's also true no one had noticed that their queen had been missing for...well, long enough for half the armies of the world to go around the world a couple of times and return, by the looks of it, and long enough for Sam to cross an entire room. She, naturally, arrives just at the right moment (when has anything not gone the Daenerys way?). I take it no one noticed the Dothraki horde standing at the gates either. Why would they?",

                    "content": "Season 6 has been a great season so far, it has become a much darker season than the ones before it. This episode was better than the two before it, with its perfectly paced storyline. While many parts (such as characters) are rushed over, which makes you wonder why the hell they even bothered to do it. However the writers have a very limited amount of story to work with, so you can understand in a way.Now to start with, the title is a bit misleading, making you believe Arya has the main story in this episode, she does not. However this does not make her scenes any less amazing. Some of the best moments of season 6 where here. The Waif posed as a very intimidating foe here, with the actress giving a very intense performance. The choreography and the cinematography with them running through the streets was fantastic. Seeing the Hound on a murderous rampage was a delight to see, I am so damn pleased they have brought him back, as he was my favourite character in the show. I really hope they don't kill him off, as they have being doing to many returning characters. The scenes in King's Landing were also much improved this time around, and like last episode, reminded me of Game of Thrones season 1 and 2, where issues aren't resolved through fighting, but through manipulation. The High Sparrow, despite not turning up, still poses to be a very great threat, and is turning out to be one of the best villains the show has had. And how badass was that Mountain moment? We haven't seen Tyrion in a good few episodes, and he makes his appearance again here, in a very lighthearted moment with Grey Worm and Missandei, leading to one of the most visual stunning shots in the show, showing the hundreds of ships sailing to Meeren.But the best moments of this episode are in Riverrun. I loved this part of the episode. Not only was it filmed brilliantly, and given a great amount of time, but it reminded me of an actual war. The gritty feel about it, the intense soundtrack played over many of the scenes. Jamie Lannister has officially become Jamie Lannister from season 1, he was very cruel and sadistic here, but heartfelt in his reunion with Brienne of F***ing-Tarth.This episode was fantastic, and people are getting annoyed with the slow pace, but I have to remind you, have you forgotten about Game of Thrones seasons 1 and 2? They were slow, with limited action, but I believe that after watching the preview for episode 9, the next episode is going to become one of the greatest episodes in TV history. I can't wait.9.5/10",

                    "content": "There aren't many words capable of describing this show's heinous vile act of inherent baboonery. It is absolutely unfathomable, completely and utterly unreasonable that this show represents the literature and is even found representing our culture. A show that even previously had the royals investment, now they air this tripe today? A show that prided itself as being better than Tolken? But there is no author on this planet who is even marginally as dyspraxic as this show. A show that literally makes no coherent attempts to formulate an otherwise plot. The characters portrayed are a pie in your face act, serving no functioning purpose outside of their disgustingly shown abilities. Was the money worth blighting our culture with this stain on humanity, surely there were other jobs for them to do just what? A show that simply wastes, for the wastefulness of it.The show has literally spoiled book 6 to rewrite book 5, why, delaying the printed literature, as the author has completely distanced from this atrocity. It had a purpose in its beginning season's telling a functioning story. Toady they go around and around in illogical circles acting like baboons (eating out of each others butts in false praise, being evolutionary devolved) for the sake of it. This season was supposedly suppose to be Winter, and I haven't seen nothing of consequence at all, just one stupid episode after the next stupider episode, although it had Hold the Door, the only episode that told a coherent story, haha.I cannot and will not be continuing watching this, reviewing it, or engaging in it further. I have placed a mental shield blocking myself from its cancer, and I couldn't even watch all of the episode last night, it was that bad, and I almost ripped my TV off the wall, proceeding to delete the entire box set. It has made me livid, seering in anger at its shown stupidity. It is simply not worth whatever its endings. It has almost got me making a bonfire out the literature, because it should not be representing anything at all when it is not even capable of making an otherwise story.In other reviews of fingers up each others bums leading to pie in the face repeated bloated head CGI acts. Brienne for no reason travels to Riverrun, meeting the biggest army Westeros has ever seen in the series. Why when both Riverrun and the Frey's had disappeared for entire seasons? She meets with the Blackfish who dies of baboonery and she waltzes off into the dusk. What was the point of that, nothing. Cersei was shamed for no reason, as she waltzes around the court and even her son is contradicting himself when he has proclaimed his faith. There was some other CGI spatter used to cement her baboonery as the Mountain makes stupid sparrows. Off to Meereen where somebody thinks that they are above their station, news flash you haven't got any Oscars and all you do is drink another bottle. Although tell me just why you made a broken deal, if you were even half as good at making them? Some CGI splats, presto Dany appears for no reason as her Dothrats are no where else. Braavos and CGI bandaging leads on to superpowers that literally fly away, adding night vision and taxidermy. What was the point of that entire arc and time spent, literally nothing.Beep, no beep you beeps, beeping the beep out of beep, wasting all that beep on beep, you aren't worth beep. BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP. Everybody now and altogether BEEP, it feels much better, BEEP it all out. I am all out of BEEP now, never again. This heinous sorcery, is no longer worth my jibes.",

Haha.If that was not enough, Arya manages to lure the Waif into an actual trap where she grabs her trusty old Needle. Blowing out the lone candle in the room and subsequently using her amazing power of hearing, she slaughters the Waif, cuts her face off with surgical precision, infiltrates the Temple and puts up a display for Jaqen H'ghar.There she utters some lines that were supposed to make us forget all this bull feces that unfolded earlier. But no, we will not forget.I mean, all I can say is that I want some of that magical Lady Crane soup!",

The whole premise of this cult was hard to swallow to begin with and has been getting serious air time that last two years. Let's start with Jacqen. They made one of the coolest characters of the early seasons into an old miser who walks around in robes all day. Occasionally, for excitement, he gets to cut a face off. Has he left the building once? What is even in this building besides a fountain and a stone table for the plastic surgery.Now to Arya and Waif. This girl has been beating on Arya every episode for the last two years, and it seemed like we were going to get an epic resolve. A chance for Arya to finally show off her training and kill the baddie. Instead we get a ridiculous choreographed Terminator 2 style chase. Waif flings grown men out of her way with the strength of Gregor Clegane. She stops pompously a couple times to breathe the summer air of Braavos, rather defeating the purpose of her T2 like sprint. The chase would be stomach-able if the fight scene made up for it. Nope. A real cop out for the writers and directors to end this story line like this. My guess is they tried to choreograph something and they didn't like it so scrapped it. Perhaps there is a reason, maybe Arya is really Waif now. At the moment though, I really dislike how it ended.",

                    "content": "Every time I confront myself against the path the mediocre script this season is following, very sadly I'm becoming more and more aware \"Game of Thrones\" has been loosing its best properties previously than I thought, since at least season 5. It's just a question of admitting or continue denying it. The main directors are really messing around and that's a fact.\"Game of Thrones\" primordial soup is not just a fantastic-medieval piece of literature, it's a very realistic fiction primarily based upon historical plots, politics, war, lineages, conquering, civilization, humanity, and the representation of the collective medieval mentality about the unknown and its fantastic world of myths transposed into bestiaries... cool and eccentric, fashionable teens making acrobatic miracles in the air posing for the cameras with shining white teeth dressed for the occasion is simply not what I have in mind when I watch the series. Nothing against it but let's separate the weeds from the wheat: that job is for Peter Jackson.While Arya was being stabbed several times and yet she was able to escape, I silently cursed myself and everything related to the series but the joy of watching her surviving the attack surpassed my rationality. Generally speaking the last episode was quite good and a breath of fresh air to the whole season. Because of that I decided to stretch the reasonable possibilities to the boundaries of my rational acceptance: Arya was stabbed multiple times, although miraculously none of the stabs perforated a vital organ or artery, strange as it sounds when the person who perpetrated the crime is a master of disguises and assassination... a microscopical possibility, yet a possibility.Following this micro-argument, even if Arya was not stabbed on a vital organ, she was stabbed multiple times and unless she was wearing some sort of armour or protection, it's impossible for some part of her muscle tissue not to be ripped off in the process. The pain would be excruciated, and she wouldn't be able to move or breathe properly...Already feeling some salty sweat sliding through my forehead I remotely accepted the possibility of Arya's adrenaline levels getting too high so that it was possible for her to escape before her body collapsed, like when sadly a dog is mortally struck by a car yet he's still able to run for a quite long distance before he ultimately shuts down and die.Even if the sum of these two nano-possibilities might be proved to be true, even so, Arya would for certain, and at the best of the chances, lay down in a semi-state of coma when finally she would stop and her body would become idle, because she has lost huge amounts of blood and stressed her body to the limit in this whole process of escaping dangerously wounded.Essentially, even if Arya was living in the 21th century treated in the best hospitals by the best doctors, her chances of surviving would be tightened by a very thin line and it would be imperative for her to rest and to be accompanied by intensive medical care for at least (this is me stretching again) 2 months... Nevertheless, I embraced this hypothesis.After my mental odyssey has finally rested I thought that in the next episode I was going to see Arya fighting for her life in a razor's edge state of life and death of a delirious semi-coma. When in this episode she reaches and she's found by Lady Crane, I expected her to be nurtured by the tender hands of a soul who after all this years of disgrace and tragedy would at long last take the role of one the members of her lost family. It would be a great moment, to watch Arya helpless as a puppy, at the mercy of anything, like a child who's infancy and dreams have been shredded and has nothing to loose yet regained the comfort of a mother after a long waiting. She more than anyone deserves that little paradise and the healing process would take its time as also as the focus of the characters development...But... Bullocks! Rubbish... Arya wakes up with a \"hangover\" and a face of a smart ass and both women spoke trivially about some stupidities concerning soups, boyfriends and the art of stitching. Enough!!! Suddenly I became indisposed. What the hell is happening with the series?I believe there's no need to criticize more, because what follows is an escalate of absurdity and the watching of the worst kind of scripting. I felt disturbed. What saves this episode from sinking to the bottom is the work of some actors, the Costume and Wardrobe Department and the Artistic Department.Congratulations to Gwendoline Christie (Brienne) who was stupendous in her work. The photography was generally great, specially portraying the right atmosphere in the Lannister tent. Also the costumes were worthy of a medieval painting done by a master. Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau (Jaime) was also very good, and the dialogue between both characters was one of the few glimpses in this episode of the truly \"Game of Thrones\".So much time wasted with nonsense, futile jokes, minor characters as the Grey Worm and Missandei (totally flat character performances and developments), the ridiculous Daenerys Targaryen catwalk entry (copy and paste from pretty much all of the seasons 5 and 6), and so little time dedicated to strong actors and characters as Clive Russell and the Brotherhood Without Banners. What a shame.Honourable mention to Dean-Charles Chapman who's performance is as always flawless. His acting fits as a glove in the role of Tommen Baratheon.My only hope in the series now resides in Lady Stoneheart.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Having been very underwhelmed, like many fans, by \"No One\" (for me a rare less-than-good episode of 'Game of Thrones' up to this point), it was a real relief to see Season 6 and 'Game of Thrones' in fact on top form with Season 6's penultimate episode. While a fan of \"Home\", \"Book of the Stranger\" and \"The Door\", it's this episode that is a contender for the magnum opus of the season and is among the show's very best.Not only because of the spectacular action, with the thrilling and uncompromising choreography and some of the best visuals of the entire show (the special effects especially, an asset nearly-consistently very good and those here is one of the finest examples). Every bit as well done are the intimately detailed character work, with Sansa and Jon the most interesting and relatable they've been all season and Ramsay perhaps at his most despicable (quite a distinction for a character as evil as he), and the emotional impact in a chilling and affecting way. The episode contains one of the show's most satisfying deaths too. Character relationships (especially Sansa and Jon), tense revelations and character and plot progression are all done well here.All the acting is never less than very good, with Kit Harington and Iwan Rheon superb, a real intensity in their conflict.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Writing is layered, passionate and sensitive throughout.In summary, the very meaning of epic in a thrilling way. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

It's very cleverly put together, as the titular battle only occupies about fifteen minutes of screen time, but it's shot in such an epic, fresh and involving way that you feel like you've been watching it for hours. Until then we get an excellent Meereen set-piece which is one of the finest the show's mounted at this point, but it's instantly surpassed by the events outside Winterfell. Superb direction is the order of the day here, the show packing in all of the intrigue, horror, gore, character beats and wonderful scenery you've come to expect. Plus, there's THAT climax, undoubtedly the most satisfying in the whole show. Excellent stuff!",

Dany begins to plan what she is going to do, which leaves the love of her life in the dust. She needs him, but must recognize the greater good. Very well done.",

They schedule a meeting with the masters to discuss the terms of surrender. However the masters misunderstand and believe Daenerys want to surrender. She rides Drogon and together with the two other dragons, they burn part of the fleet. Meanwhile Daario and the Dothraki attack the Sons of the Harpy. Then Yara and Theon team up with Daenerys that accepts the independence of the Iron Isles and to overthrow Euron.In Winterfell, Jon Snow, Sansa, Davos and Tormund meet with Ramsay and Jon Snow proposes a dispute between them instead of sacrificing lives in a battle. Ramsay does not accept and they schedule the battle in the morning. Jon Snow plots a scheme with Davos and Tormund and Sansa warns that Ramsay plays dirty. When both armies are ready to battle, Ramsay brings a surprise that affects Jon and his army. Who will win the bloody battle? \"Battle of the Bastards\" is one of the best episodes of Game of Thrones (if not the best). This masterpiece shows powerful women (Daenerys, Yara and Sansa) and the most incredible battles. There is nothing more to say about this perfect episode that has not been written before. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Battle of the Bastards\"",

                    "content": "The previous episode saw the Slavers launching their attack on Meereen and Daenerys returning. She, along with Tyrion, Grey Worm and Missandei, meet the leaders of the slavers to discuss terms of surrender; they assume they have won but Daenerys is expecting their surrender. They are almost amused till Daenerys's dragons attack their fleet and the Dothraki destroy the Sons of the Harpy. Later Yara and Theon Greyjoy offer to help her return to Westeros with her forces in return for giving Yara the Salt Throne.Back in Westeros the battle for Winterfell is about to begin; Jon meets Ramsey and suggests the two of them decide things in one to one combat\u0085 an offer Ramsey unsurprisingly declines. Knowing they are outnumbered Jon's commanders discuss what they should do. Sansa in irritated that none of them think of consulting her; the only one they to really know Ramsey Bolton. She cautions him that Ramsey will play dirty and they must accept that their brother Rickon is effectively dead already. Her words prove prophetic as Ramsey forces Rickon to run to his brother while firing arrows at him; Jon is drawn out and soon the armies are engaged in pitched battle; all the while Ramsey's archers fire, not worried whether they hit their enemies or their own men. The battle moves against Jon and his allies till, just when it looks like all is lost, an unexpected ally arrives and turns the tide of the battle.Viewers have come to expect each 'episode nine' to be something special and this one is no exception. The opening scenes in Meereen are great. There is a fine scene between Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke as Tyrion counsels Daenerys not to be too extreme in dealing with the attackers. She listens but that doesn't mean we don't get some spectacular scenes as her dragons burn slaver ships and thousands of Dothraki slaughter the Sons of the Harpy. This was an exciting battle with fantasy elements; the battle for Winterfell was far more brutal, bloody and dirty. The battle scenes were some of the most intense yet with large numbers of combatants. The resolution won't have come as too much of a surprise; especially by anybody spotted Aidan Gillen's name in the cast list during the opening credits! The battle may have been brutal but it wasn't as brutal as what Sansa did to Ramsey after the battle was won. Sophie Turner put in a great performance showing her characters steeliness; for the first time I'm starting to wonder if one day she will be the proclaimed the 'Queen in the North'. Overall I'd say that this was a brilliant episode that delivered everything expected and more.",

The ending with Sansa terrific, Sophie and Iwan have great chemistry. Ramsay had just started becoming an enjoyable character and he's killed. Why Rickon doesn't deviate his running pattern after time has passed between arrows, I cannot fathom. The battle's great, but the giant could of been used much more effectively and some of the shaky cam in the congested fight scene as Jon's stuck underneath, gets tiresome.Jon, Ramsay, Sansa and Daenerys the standouts.",

Tonight just about went down the way I thought it would, but that didn't take away from the brilliance of the episode on all fronts.I didn't think we would get anything besides the battle brewing in the North, but we got a decent amount of Meereen material. We saw Daenerys ride her Drogon again a few weeks back, but seeing her tear right through any hopes The Masters had of taking down Meereen was just awesome. Throw in the appearance of all 3 dragons together in one continuous shot sent chills down my spine.It's hard to come out of the episode not thinking about that final shot in Winterfell, but the Greyjoys meeting with Tyrion and Dany deserves some attention as well. Not only was it nice to hear some more history behind these two families, but I believed every word coming from both sides. For once it seems this house alliance makes sense and won't end in tragedy.But onto the North, I think the battle went down pretty much the way people speculated, but I dug every second of it. Everything from the devastation in Jon Snow's eyes when he sees his brother die to the sweeping long shots of swords, arrows, and horses flying all over the place made 'Battle of the Bastards' one for history books. Everyone behind the scenes deserves a ton of credit for this one.Even the stuff that went past the battlefield like the Jon and Sansa conflict was well done. Over the course of the show they haven't had the lengthy screen time that other duos have, but they are now consistently one of the best acted and written parts of the show. Same goes for the back and forth between Tormund and Daavos and even Ramsay and Jon. Absolutely loved it.It's only fitting Ramsay gets eaten by his own dogs. Of course, he had to get his final tragic game in by killing Rickon. That was unfortunate. But I've been pulling for Ghost to get the kill for quite some time now, but I think I can settle for Ramsay's hounds. Goes right next to Joffrey as probably the most satisfying death in the show's history. Sansa's final smirk though? Perfect.There were a few things here and there that didn't work as well though. Daavos conveniently finding Shireen's little toy in the wood felt a little forced, but it will certainly have an impact going forward. There were also times the editing and cuts inside the battlefield that made it difficult to see what was going on. But nitpicks for sure. 'Battle of the Bastards' is one of the best pieces of art this show has given us in its 6 year run, and I can only hope next week has a similar effect.+Goodbye Ramsay+That battle tho+Sansa's subtle smile+Greyjoy and Targaryen alliance makes sense10/10",

Really like some of that negotiation scene where Bolton is practically taunting, trying to intimidate, just simply talking crap toward both. We see both of them aren't bending toward it, I really like how both of them don't say too much toward him and they don't need to as we just see both of them just give Bolton this cold stare, from that you already know the negotiation is over as both of them have already made up their minds even before they says what they say to him; from that moment I thought \"Prepare to die, blowhole!\"Despite how good a strategist Bolton is I know his weakness, he's full of arrogance, he's much to sure of himself always thinking people are going to do exactly what he expects them to do like his dogs; but human nature is never predicable. Even like that final conversation scene both Jon and Sansa have about the battle, which I thought really shows how much both have grown as characters and despite how long it's been the brother and sister bond still exists and is stronger than ever. It's emotional in that conversation as both know the risks of this battle, both also know they have to do what must be done to not just honor their kingdom but their love for their family.The beginning of the battle was really suspenseful as we are both unsure of how it will begin but also if victory for Jon's army is possible, despite the stratagem they planned in the strategy session the possibility of success is slim as Bolton unfortunately has higher numbers so yeah the odds are sadly against the Northern Army.We see Bolton play a game with one of the Jon's youngest brothers making him run to Jon, but this isn't a game as it's just a form of execution as we see Bolton is firing arrows toward him. I couldn't help but be on the edge of my seat hopping Jon will ride fast enough toward his brother and just when Jon gets close enough, the arrow drops.Once that arrow fell on Jon's brother, that moment was heart sinking and at the same time just made the blood in both Jon and I explode into a volcanic eruption as he then charges in alone head on into battle, that moment I thought \"That's it, the chainsaw is coming out!\" The battle is just beautifully choreographed, not too fanciful which makes it all the better making the battle feel slightly realistic. Also like the cinematography, one shot I really like was seeing Jon standing alone on the battlefield seeing the Bolton army charge toward him and he simply goes into a stance with his sword drawn, it is such a beautiful shot, simply one standing against evil.It's awesome seeing Jon just kicking butt and taking names, we see as he is going forward, he is just cutting down any of Bolton scum army that dare frak with him. But then round two begins when we see Jon's company entrapped in Bolton's phalanx maneuver along with that pile of bodies behind them with more of Bolton's army on top. Really like how we see Jon and company constantly fighting, for a little while it looks like they could possibly break though the Phalanx and turn things around, one really good kill was seeing a giant take one of Bolton's men and then just ripping the scum sucker in half like a toy figurine. But despite their efforts it's to no avail and so the North Army tries to escape up the bodied hill despite the opposition above, but then we see Jon in another bad situation which is another suspenseful moment which actually put me on edge and even had me gasping for breath as we see he is getting buried in bodies, but also shows a little of the awful reality of war how ugly it can truly get.Everything seems almost hopeless for the Northern Company and Bolton's strategy seems like Bolton is about to win. But unfortunately, there was one huge detail Bolton failed to consider and that is Sansa. Sansa we see rides in with back up for the Northern Army and then we see they're practically plowing the road of Bolton's army. There is another good cinematography shot of Jon whom is just bloody, dirty covered in grime and sut which reflects his state of mind as we see him look a Bolton from a distance just pissed as hell, which just puts the fear in Bolton as he knows he next on Jon kill list. It's poetic justice as Bolton has always ruled and attained power though fear, but now that very thing has turned against him.The final scene in this were just beautiful, really like that face off both Jon Snow and Bolton have. Is firing arrow but each arrow Jon block with the Shield, it's just great seeing how Jon continually advance on Bolton, like Jason Vorhees zeroing in on the kill. And when Jon gets close enough, he just beats the living crap out of him, I honestly couldn't help but cheer and pretend I was joining in on that beating. Jon just really unleashes all inferno hell into that beating in a way that reflect my own and everyone else's feelings toward that character, how much pain, misery, and death he has caused toward Sonsa and all other unfortunate souls. There is another little beautiful scene as we see Bolton's sick flag has been taken down and now the Stark flag flies once more on their house, seeing that you know the Starks are finally back in business.The ending is just satisfying as once again poetic justice is delivered, really loved that final monologue Sansa delivers at the end which in a way was exactly what I had in mind for him it was just beautiful sort of her way of delivering the finishing blow, showing he could not break her spirit it's stronger than ever before. Jon and Sansa have served Bolton his cold dish so bone appetite in hell.Rating: 4 stars",

The script, the direction, the music and the cinematography: nothing's sidelined in this episode. Everything, from the arcs of Jon Snow, Tyrion, Daenerys and Ramsey, all adds up to one of the brand-new touchstones of television.

The battle between Jon Snow and Ramsay Bolton is the best action sequence I've ever seen and it's right up there with the battle sequences in Season 4.The sets are still lavish especially the castle of Ramsay Bolton and the costumes and scenery are still beautiful. The writing is solid as it delivers the stakes for Jon Snow to try and bring justice to Ramsay Bolton and keeps you invested. The directing is brilliant, the editing is really good, and Ramin Djawadi delivers some of the most brilliant action music with suspense and intensity. The characters are still believable and Ramsay Bolton continues to be really effective as the villain. Iwan Rheon, who played him in season 3, did a fantastic job in making him so despicable much like Jack Gleeson did as King Joffrey.Since it's been two days, I like to say that Ramsay Bolton is finally gone. He tortured Theon Greyjoy and when he killed Rickon Stark before the battle started, it made me hate him even more.That being said, the highlights of the episode are the performances and the battle sequences. Kit Harington and Sophie Turner delivers some of their solid lines together and so does Iwan Rheon, who brings menace to Ramsay perfectly as he did when he was first introduced. Peter Dinklage and Emilia Clarke along with Alfie Allen and Gemma Whelan are also good in the conversation scene at the palace in Meereen with Daenerys agreeing to use the Iron Fleet for battle if the two promise not to pillage anymore.Overall, Battle of the ******** is an epic episode and delivered what it promised. Good character development, solid writing, some of the best battle sequences since season 4, and excellent acting. Thumbs up :). Can't wait for the season finale.",

What I really liked was the camera angles got closer than any other camera angle would be, also the goriest battle scene ever seen. It had the feeling of claustrophobia at one specific part also the dragons were looking exceptionally gorgeous today, in fact I actually think that is the best CGI ever done in TV. Well the budget for the entire show now is $10 million and it looks like they are making that money worth it. Imagine if this were to break a World Record for most deaths in one episode if not the entire season. Anyway season 6 is the bloodiest and the best season out there, this will remain the greatest TV show on the planet especially after that brilliant episode. 10/10",

Another thing taught is to give a person as much pain as you can bear. Don't do anything to him that will kill you. No girl forgets to hurt her honor. Somehow, by doing something, he keeps on avenging the loss of his self-esteem. And no queen should think less. I think once in a while at the right time. One thing to always remember is that as shown in this episode, all things have a limit. Exceeding the limit is bound to cause the downfall of any human being. Speaking of episodes, I would say this is the best episode of season 6 and the whole series I saw. Let's see how good or bad the next episodes will be.",

Miguel Sapochnik is now officially the best director on Game of Thrones (he also did last year's Hardhome). The pacing, the cinematography, the acting, the writing; everything in here was perfect. It depicts the horrors of war in such a brutal and stunning way. It feels like they've finally got the budget to take the series to the scale they've always wanted it at. Just an all around epic episode. It also plays sharp contrast to last week's episode, which I personally found slightly disappointing.Surprisingly, the episode isn't just set in one location (although it almost is). We also check in with Meereen, which is good because I thought the cliffhanger they were left on last episode would stretch for two weeks. It didn't. The episode leaps right into it. This was quite a smart pacing decision; by opening the episode with a battle, you prevent people from getting fed up with the long stretch of character scenes that precedes the other battle. Just the right amount of time was spent in Meereen this episode.But then, of course, it's on to the main event. The Battle of the Bastards. As with all the other big battle episodes in Game of Thrones, we check in with all the characters who will be fighting in the battle. It reminds us of the stakes, develops character, and builds anticipation.In this episode, we see that Ramsay is in fact a brilliant strategist. His battle plan is horrifying, manipulative, and very well thought out. The effects on the ground are very well portrayed. There is one tracking shot that follows a character through the battle that absolutely blew me away. It captures the sheer senselessness, the pure chaos of battle in such a mind-blowing way. The only thing I found even marginally disappointing about this episode was the character deaths; I wish there were more of them! But that's probably just me being masochistic.What an absolutely fantastic ride of an episode, I hope the finale delivers.",

But very lucky. In this episode the \"deus ex machina\" had to do hard work twice. First time was OK so far, second time was not. I feel frustrated about this episode, because it could have been so much better than your average slaughter-fest. Is it really this, what so many are expecting from GOT ? I can't believe that, even seeing so many applauding here.It's almost a pity that Ramsey Bolton, who was indeed depicted as an outrageous person, also was one of the only two good strategists in this season, along with the High Septon. The others were merely driven by the circumstances or their wrong decisions, not by real initiative, and not by bigger plans. To see one declared schemer leading the cavalry was not an easy thing to swallow. It had a stale taste, which added to the mostly foreseeable and therefore somewhere boring processes of this episode. As a counter-example I recall the episode where Daenerys burns the complete leadership of the Dothrakis. That was an unexpected twist (of course announced with hints, but, well, not at such a scale).Even if it shines there and then, I think that GOT has story-wise quite outlived itself since the end of season 4. The only ray of hope this season was the reactivation of Sandor Clegane, but after we didn't see anything about him in this episode, he seems, for now, to be rather irrelevant. At least until mid-season 7 (given the ordinary pacing of GOT).",

                    "content": "Let me just start by expressing shock at the reviews. What people might actually like in this episode is a complete mystery to me. Do audiences want happy endings so much that they don't give a damn how you get there? Anyway, allow me to elaborate in the form of a rant.Last we heard, Meereen was under attack by submarines, or some other kind of ship that approaches unseen. Daenerys had just returned on her somehow now trained dragon and is now looking at Tyrion with all the obnoxiousness she can muster. They then proceed to defeat the invading fleet with the aid of dragons (and well, nothing else), since the attackers had apparently never considered that dragons may be used against them in the event of a battle. Immediately after that, the teleporting Ironborn arrive at the most convenient of times (Samwell Tarly has almost reached the front door of his father's estate), and offer to help her take the seven kingdoms in exchange of independence for the iron islands with Yara as queen. Daenerys is easily convinced because a) female ruler b) she can't count, so repeatedly fails to realise that this only leaves her six kingdoms. As always, Gladstone Gander gets everything her way in unconvincing manner. Based on the speed of the iron fleet, Daenerys should arrive at the 7 kingdoms 4 episodes ago, just as Samwell Tarly arrives at his father's estate.Meanwhile, Jon prepares to attack Winterfell. Somewhere along the battle preparations, D&D take the time to use Davos in order to remind us just how much they messed up last year, as the man who once said \"King Stannis is my god\" now says \"oh well, Stannis' death was his own fault because he listened to Melissandre, the woman I hate but also implored to resurrect some guy I barely knew, and who, as I am just now remembering? realising?, burned Sireen\" (seriously, when I realised he probably doesn't even know what happened to Sireen I flipped out. His so far complete indifference towards Stannis' death is even more outrageous). We get a lot of \"oh, no, the odds are against us\", peppered with some \"why don't you ask for my advice\", \"what is your advice\", \"I DON'T KNOW JON, JUST LEAVE ME ALONE\" (should I tell him about the massive reinforcements that may be arriving? Nah). We get Rickon's death, which only says \"we have no idea what to do with yet another character whose story we ignored\", we get small reminders that no one has yet understood why the Umbers and the Karstarks thought disposing of Roose Bolton was a decent idea, we get to wonder how, with the addition of two of the biggest Northern Houses, Ramsay has a fifth of the laughably large army he had last season.But you know what, at least they knew. D&D knew how idiotic their resolution was. They knew, deep down, they are polluting a fictional universe with ideas that come from another (where they weren't too welcome either). So they showed the banner just so everybody watching could mock them in unison with a resounding \"The eagles! The eagles are coming!\". Yet again, the impeccably ludicrous timing of poor storytelling makes its appearance in the shape of Lord Baelish.Of course, some of us have been paying attention to the story. Some of us remember. Some of us know that no army from the south can cross into the north except through the almost impregnable Moat Cailin. Which is.....correct, controlled by the Boltons. Remember how Ramsay had sent Theon to trick the ironborn into leaving? In fact, some of us can deduce that much like not realising a fleet has docked in your harbour until it starts raining fire, not realising an army is marching through your lands is also a little unlikely. So, for once, everything goes as expected. For once the good guys win. And for the second season in a row, Game of Thrones gives us an outrageously bad 9th episode, all because its writers can't even imitate a poor imitator of George Martin.I know. Someone will surely say that in game of thrones, when everything turn out predictably, that's unpredictable - a reasoning which makes some sense, so you can imagine the magnitude of the failure when you are not the least surprised by the \"happy\" ending - or anything else in this episode. But you see, the fault lies elsewhere: \"tragic\" outcomes were never there (merely) for the sake of shocking the reader/viewer. They were a plausible, or probable even, consequence of the plot. In this case, it's the consequence of a sad array of bad clich\u00e9s. They made a plot which relied on everything going in Ramsay's favour without explanation or feasibility, just to build up the tension for the final confrontation. But that's the way to make a Rocky sequel. Or an episode of Batman with Adam West.Last season I felt betrayed because the writers had committed an unforgivable sin by murdering (the character and whole story line of) Stannis. This year they, above all else, insult my intelligence.",

Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.The previous episode is a mind-blowing experience and one would naturally think it would be impossible to top by anything that was to follow. \"The Winds of Winter\" actually does this impossible feat. It is an exceptional episode, what 'Game of Thrones' is all about and how to do a season finale for anything. Would go as far to say it's the best season finale of 'Game of Thrones', with the previous seasons for me the penultimate episode of each season made more of an impression than the finale whereas here the finale is on the same level of the penultimate episode and even exceeds it.Season 6 for me has had all but one episode ranging from good to brilliant, the exception being \"No One\", the only episode of the first six seasons to receive a less than decent rating and review (personal opinion and most likely not a popular opinion with the show having some controversial episodes and not all fans liking Season 5). Didn't hate it, but it did leave me underwhelmed. \"The Winds of Winter\" is the season's best.It made me truly excited for the next season. Character development and plot progression move forward and advance more than any other episode before, things are answered, some questions are raised from things being introduced and put into place and there are major shocking revelations that are game changing.Nothing can be faulted with the acting, where nobody is bad and everybody is great or more. Lena Headey being a revelation.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Writing is layered, passionate and sensitive throughout.Summing up, brilliant. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The direction, from a returning Miguel Sapochnik, is inspired and beautiful and the piano score complements the on-screen action perfectly. It seems inevitable now that things would build to this moment, but what an oddly satisfying moment it is! It feels like all of the boring old sub-plots have been swept aside in readiness for the end game. A shame about Margery, but then good characters always die with bad. The rest of the episode isn't quite so profound, more talky than anything else, and the scenes with Sam and Tyrion ring a little hollow given what's come before. This is still excellent stuff, however.",

Margaery Tyrell finds strange their absences and warns High Sparrow to immediately leave the place. However his army does not allow Margaery, Loras and the worshipers to go. What will happen to them?

Jon Snow is claimed King of the North by the other families after the speech of Lyanna Mormont.\"The Winds of Winter\" is another excellent episode of Game of Thrones. Cersei finally shows her claws and shows no mercy to her enemies. Her vengeance is amazing and very cruel. Arya's revenge is also very creepy. The Machievellian Tyrion forces the separation of Daenerys and her love to fulfill her ambition. But Lyanna Mormont steals the show with her speech to the families from the North. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"The Winds of Winter\"",

Previous seasons had managed this very well, and this season does it almost as well. The difference here is that the story-telling and characters do feel a lot more on the surface than before. This is seen in some specific characters but also generally across the board there is a lot less time/detail which speaks to the characters themselves. We also have some odd decisions regarding where to slow things down and spend a bit more time than in other areas \u2013 eg time spent with Tyrion drinking and joking did not seem to add as much time as it needed.Mostly the show is driven forward by the events though, and in this regard it is mostly strong. This benefits from the investment of the audience (nobody is trying to jump in fresh at this point) and this buys it some forgiveness for its weaker elements. There are plenty of dramatic moments/sequences/threads, and lots of resolutions and movement to be held by. These are delivered as professionally as the high quality we have come to expect, and there is an intensity to all of it which engages \u2013 consequences feel very real, even in this fantasy world. Some threads did not work as well; Arya's thread never really worked for me, and it felt like Daenerys has basically spent the last few seasons in a loop of similar plotting even if it is moving forward each time.Production values, performances, and dramatic spectacle all make this a season which is of the usual high standards. It continues to grip and engage, even if elements of this season were weaker and a little disappointing as to what they could have been.",

Loras confesses his sins but Cersei declines to attend and prevents Tommen from attending; Margaery Tyrell realises that something is terribly wrong and tries to evacuate the sept; she is too late. This supporting Cersei detonate a cache of wildfire, destroying the building. On learning what has happened Tommen jumps from the keep. In Winterfell the northern families rally round Jon Snow; the new 'King in the North' and Melisandre is ordered to leave the north and never return because of her murder of Stannis Baratheon's daughter. At Riverrun the Lannisters and the Frey's celebrate their victory\u0085 Walder Frey doesn't celebrate for long as Arya Stark is back in Westeros and is swift to take her revenge against him. Across the Narrow Sea Daenerys makes Tyrion her 'Hand of the Queen' shortly before her fleet finally sets sail for Westeros.After all the excitement of the previous episode I wasn't expecting this to be as dramatic as it was. It was fairly obvious that something would happen at the trial but I certainly didn't expect anything as dramatic as the destruction of the sept by Cersei, nor did I expect that by the end of the episode she would be sitting on the Iron Throne. Lena Headey was as good as ever as she coldly destroyed those who had opposed her. The fate of Walder Frey at the hands of Arya was most satisfactory and gave a delightful nod to 'Titus Andronicus' as he is served his less than appetising final meal. The events elsewhere may not have been as dramatic but they set things up nicely for things to come; notably Daenerys's return to Westeros, Olenna Tyrell's determination to get revenge for the loss of her family in Cersei's action and the families of the north rallying behind Jon before the long promised war against the White Walkers. There was also a surprising revelation concerning the identity of Jon's mother. Overall this was a great conclusion to the series; I can't wait to see how season seven turns out.",

                    "content": "Coming off one of the best episodes of any show of all time with last week's 'Battle of the Bastards', it was going to be hard for Game of Thrones to create something even remotely as great. To me, 'The Winds of Winter' may be even better. Not only did it give us the final shot we wanted (Daenerys riding to Westeros), but it also concluded just about every major season 6 arc in the most satisfying way possible. I don't often praise the writing and directing in TV Shows, but if there was ever a time, it is now.As episode 9's central conflict was the battle for the North, the trial in King's Landing was the big event in episode 10. And boy did it not disappoint. I think just about everyone was getting fed up with the High Sparrow, so to see him go up in the flames of wildfire was extremely overdue. With that said, Cersei's descend into madness didn't go without its unfortunate consequences as both the king and the queen met their end. Tommen's suicide seemed like a fitting way for a coward like him to go out. On the other hand, I was definitely sad to see Margaery go. I always figured if she were to meet her end it would be at the hands of Cersei, but I thought there was going to be more to her story. Luckily, we still have a few Tyrell's laying around.At first, I was confused as to why we were getting any sort of Sand Snake/Dorne scene in the finale, but when I saw Lady Olenna Tyrell, it all started to make sense. It makes perfect sense that the Tyrell's and Sand's would combine their armies, with the help of Varys, alongside Dany's to take on the Lannister's. Is there really any question Dany will have no issue taking on the Lannister's army now? Some of the Ironborn, Dothraki, Unsullied, Tyrell's, Dorne, and let's not forget 3 dragons. Come on now.Mixed in with plenty of big momentum shifters were some small but important scenes with Sam at the Citadel and Arya checking someone off her list. The somewhat comedic scene where Sam discovers the library after struggling to get past the so called gatekeeper wasn't entirely necessary, but it was nonetheless cool to see the vastness of knowledge that place holds. However, the Arya scene was easily one of my favorite moments of the night. I was glad to see the Starks finally got some sort of redemption for the Red Wedding even if it was Arya taking her murderousness one step further.The next big Stark reveal came from another one of Bran's vision, as he finally got to see the conclusion of the Tower of Joy sequence. Not that Jon Snow's mother being Lyanna Stark came as a surprise to anyone, but it finally set those theories straight. Sure, we didn't get to hear all of what Lyanna said to Ned that day in the tower, but if the not-so-subtle transition from the baby to Snow's face meant anything, I think we have another Targaryen on the loose.Speaking of which, that brings me to the ever-so-satisfying second \"King of the North\" moment with the North finally embracing (and remembering) who the true leader of Winterfell is, and their name is Stark. It would have been nice for that moment to feature Sansa as well, especially after all she's been through, but both are deserving. I also shouldn't forget just how good that scene between Daavos, Melisandre, and Jon was. Well written, acted (particularly from Liam Cunningham), and directed. Seems like the theme of tonight.Of course, it's not a great Thrones episode without Tyrion, who now serves as the hand of the *Queen*. Or how about watching Maester Pycelle meet his deserved end. Or Cersei torturing Septa Unella AKA the same lady? Or even the look of disgust on the face of Jaime as he watched his beloved Cersei take the throne. This episode featured just about every major character from this show and gave them each a fitting end to their arcs this season. I honestly can't speak high enough about the direction from Miguel Sapochnik and writing from David and Dan. Even just looking at the flawless transitions from scene to scene deserve tons of credit. It will go down as one of my favorite episodes of the series thus far, and certainly most important.+Impeccable direction+Winter is here+Cersei goes mad+Arya checks Frey off her list+King of the North+Tyrell's and Sand's team up+Dany rides towards the throne+Daavos10/10",

An iconic episode that just everything you would dream it to be. I noticed this episode was rated a 10 for a while before becoming a 9.9 and quite a few ones given probably by Breaking Bad fanboys who don't want Ozymandias to be dethroned. Well kids I got news for you, GOT has already dethroned Breaking Bad in the top TV ratings and its greatest episodes shall do the same, GOT has outclassed BB.I have said this before, Game of Thrones as a show has no equal in modern times.",

The Winds of Winter continues the high standards. The directing is great, the editing is really neat, Ramin Djawadi continues to make some more beautiful music, and the script is well-written. The writing is really good, the characters are still believable, the relationships continue to shine, the pacing is really good and never drags. The story-arcs have been advanced perfectly, but since I just saw the episode, I'm not going to spoil anything.Season 6 has been a great year for Game of Thrones so far. What started out as a slow, but still good beginning, became better thanks to emotional performances from the Stark and Lannister people, strong writing, and did I forget to mention that the action sequences are the best I've seen since the fourth season? Also, with Ramsay Bolton gone, if we see the White Walkers and their leader again in the next season, things might get interesting.Overall, The Winds of Winter is another classic episode and a solid season finale. Can't wait for the seventh season! Thumbs up! :)",

Usually the finale is basically cool down and just finishing off points from the season as it has been since season 1, however this ending is the best ending to a season. I mean wow when D.B Weiss and David Benioff announced that this would be the best season and also the bloodiest they were right because this was literally drenched in blood. However a few of the episodes could have been done better but it was that real clincher from episode 5 that showed us that this is the best TV show on Earth. Now that winter is here there are going to be a lot more battles and glimpses of the white walkers. I think there will also be some very big battles especially the Battle of Ice and Fire yet to come. Unfortunately there were no white walkers this episode but an amazing end, start off with that music by Ramin Djawadi which was beautifully done and from that music you expect a lot and it delivered.This episode did stick with the tradition of the usual season endings but with the first ten minutes it went okay-ish to excellent in just that short time. In conclusion with season fives ending it left little doubt that season 6 would've been an okay season but it got past that doubt and terrific style I might add, will it \"hold the door?\" or will it reveal it's darkest secrets in season seven to come next year. Bring it on it is going to be a long 10 months but it's going to be worth it. Best ending ever. 10/10",

I was admittedly quite nervous going into this episode; there was so much they had to stuff in. There was the distinct possibility of this episode becoming way too crammed with things and coming across rushed, like last season's finale did. Well, I can now safely say that I need not have worried. This episode balanced everything marvellously. There were massive violent twists and big moments, but they were laced in equally with touching little character interactions. In fact, the sequence that I had assumed would be the climax of this episode ended up being at the very beginning. And what a wonderful sequence it was. Ramin Djawadi did excellent work with the score accompanying the scene; it really helped to draw out the tension.During the first three seasons, there were certainly a lot of story lines, but they all tied back into one central story-line for the most part; the war of the five kings. The Red Wedding changed all if that; sent everyone their separate ways. As a result, the story lines drifted farther and farther apart from each other as time went on. That was fine in season 4, when they were all very eventful. But in season 5, when we were in a slower stage of the story, some people felt understandably frustrated. There was no sense of general momentum running through the whole of the show. D&D knew this, and so they were anxious to get through it as quickly as possible which led to some of it coming across rushed. People started saying that the show had lost its edge. But I don't think that's what it was. I think it was just in the middle chapter. The \"Two Towers\" of the Song of Ice and Fire saga. What this season has done is brought things back together. These characters, with their new experiences, are put back into the game. The middle chapter is over, and that has never been clearer than it was at the end of this episode. Three sides have emerged. All the houses have rallied to one side or another. Every story-line comes into play at the end of this episode and it is thrilling (except for Gendry... I guess he's still rowing). Things are in place for the final two seasons. Here we go.One last note; I'm pretty sure that thing suspended from the ceiling in the Oldtown library is the sun thing from the opening credits. That's a pretty cool detail.",

This season did not go in the way that I had expected (given the last horrific way the last season ended) and I was very glad of it. In true Game of Thrones fashion, both beloved and hated characters die and story lines I hoped would developed more delivered well, and more. Cersei burns all her enemies, including the Tyrell children, which causes her son Tommen to rightfully commit suicide. But, disturbingly, Cersei is not as devastated as she should be, as she is proclaimed The Queen afterwards, just as her brother Jaime walks, horrified. Selling one's soul to the devil for success only brings you enemies after all. Arya Stark is back in Westeros and crosses another name off her list. Jon Snow is proclaimed King of The North after taking back Winterfell, but there is a catch: Bran reveals through a flashback that he has another highborn title as well as Stark.And, after making speech after speech of how she will conquer Westeros, Daenerys FINALLY sets sail with her boats from the Greyjoys off to the land where she once came. The abused and victimized women take back the power that was stolen from them and finally get rid of the nasty lords who try to rule over and intimidate people for power. About bloody time, indeed.Now we wait to see where these actions will take the next season.",

                    "content": "Another year, another Game of Thrones season over. Season 6 of Game of Thrones is potentially one of the best season of television ever made. I thought that this season brought together all the best parts of Game of Thrones that we have started to love the past 6 years and put it into turbo mode. I think full credit to the writers being able to take this characters that George R Martin has sculpted and taken them to a whole new level.Onto the finale itself, Game of Thrones finales are always a really different format to what we are use to for normal TV finales. Normally we have to big dramatic ending with the last 10 or so minutes setting up for the next season to follow. What Game of Thrones does each and every season is have the big showstopper episode 9 and they do those last minute tip offs and set ups for the next season. Yet again we got the same amazing format this year. After the amazing Battle of the Bastards episode last week, we knew that this episode was going to be more of an all round episode that had a bit of everything.By far the biggest surprise of the episode was Cersi as the Mad Queen. I had strong vibes like many other people that this episode was going to be the end for Tommen and of course it was. What was the biggest surprise though was the end for so many other characters, most importantly, The High Sparrow and Margery. I never really took a moment to thought what the future of these characters would be for the end of the show. I just always kind of assumed they were going to just be around. But that is Game of Thrones for you. You think someone is safe, then they are gone. I have to say full credit to the director for the opening of this episode. The sequence with no words being spoken for the most part and the piano in the background just built the tone of the episode and I thought it was amazing. That can also be said with the work on the Wildfire destroying the church. I thought that scene looked amazing. Capping off everything at Kings Landing, I never thought Cersi would actually get the throne at any point. I always thought that it would go through a few hands but always be just out of reach of her. Now she is officially the Mad Queen.The other big moment of the episode was the final resolution to a point of R + L = J. While I really loved everything with Bran and how we got a sort of prequel sequence, I was waiting for it to have a overall meaning for the show as a whole. In this episode we got it. We got to see Bran follow Ned up to the Tower of Joy and get to see a little baby Jon. Anyone who was following this theory knew straight away it what was going on and knew it was Jon. For those who don't know the theory however, I thought the episode did a great transition between baby Jon and Jon now which let us easily connect the two together. What needs to be addressed next season though is that now we have the L = J part of the theory confirmed, we just have to wait to see if we get the R side of it.The last big part of the episode that I have to touch on is Daenarys. I got to say that the scene with her and Tyrion where she gave him the pin to name him Hand of the Queen was amazing. The amount of emotion that was in the scene was one of the most emotional scenes I have seen this year in television. Moving on from that scene itself, Daenarys finally is heading to Westeros. That scene at the end with all the ships and the dragons was THE scene we have been waiting for since the end of season 4. Daenarys really hit a momentum stop last season and it was finally great to have her ruling yet again and back on track of taking the thrones.The way it is heading, after this finale, I'm counting on Daenarys as Queen of the 7 Kingdoms, Sansa the Queen of Winterfell as she is the most elder Stark, Jon Targaryen is a strong force next to her cousin Daenarys in Kings Landing and good old Tyrion is acting as the Hand of the Queen with his loyal brother Jaymie head of the Kings Guard.10/10",

                    "content": "Surprise. An episode even worse than the previous one. I understand lots of people loved it. I saw the ratings. In disbelief. Because it was unthinkably bad. Unthinkably. Before I attack every single part of it (save the music), let me single out two scenes:One, we finally get little needed confirmation that Jon Snow is Lyanna's son. This is made clear to anyone who had doubts in Bran's vision. Afterwards, the camera zooms in on the baby's face. And zooms out on Jon's, directly, shamelessly saying \"we think fans are complete morons and may need this visual confirmation\". Now, it would bother me less, if not for the fact that the entire story, every single thread of it, is written as if aimed at an audience that is composed of idiots who need this sort of visual aid.Two, Varys. He conveniently appears in Dorne in time to know already about what JUST happened in King's Landing. At the end of the episode, he's on the ship with Daenerys. If you noticed that and didn't think that the writers are far, far worse than Ed Wood, well, I give up.I had expectations from GoT. Not because it is based on a series of books that doesn't consider the reader a fool, but because the show itself lived up to these standards for four and a half seasons. Now, Chuck Norris films are more coherent.But let's take it from the top:Cersei decides to blow up the Sept and everyone in it. She has been repeatedly been described as a selfish, cruel woman who would however do anything for her children. So, logically, she kills everything and everyone her last living son loves. Then he kills himself, but life goes on apparently. Nobody cares, not for the fact she blew up the city, not for the fact she took the throne (how?). Her plan of course relied on her not being taken to the Sept earlier, on one of Qyburn's sparrows luring Lancel directly to the source of the wildfire (why) and then not killing him so he can have a chance to prevent it. Murdering all allies, check. Being left with no support from anyone, check. Make son hate me for the rest of eternity, check. Oh, wait, he killed himself. Boo-hoo. To be fair, Cersei does stupid things in the books too. Just not quite that stupid. Lest we forget, that is exactly how D&D treated Stannis. Go on and on about how much he loves his daughter, then kills her. Cersei does the same, then doesn't really care all that much. Exactly like with Stannis, D&D once again exhibit their abysmal lack of understanding of what a plot twist is. That it needs to make sense, rather than just go against what you spent much time establishing.Meanwhile, Jaime dines with Walder Frey. Then Walder Frey is confronted by Arya, who has easily teleported back to Riverrun, and using the skills she spent much time mostly failing to acquire, she kills him. Hooray, said fans who don't care if that made sense.Towards the end, Jaime teleports himself back to King's Landing.Speaking of teleportation, the queen of thorns has teleported to Dorne, invited by the Sand Snakes and Elaria, who apparently called her a minute after the explosion. Varys is there, but also super- positioned in a ship with Daenerys, who is now best friends with fan favourite *hint* Tyrion, because the show has decided to suddenly become the wet dream of those fans it thinks it's addressing. Which translates to \"suddenly, le wild convenience appeared, and everything goes the ludicrous Daenerys way\". Teleporting Varys, teleporting ironborn, last episode's joke of a battle, Daenerys moving to Westeros where, conveniently ( when has anything gone wrong for her?) no one is left to challenge her. Hooray, said Daenerys fans, who have long lost any demands for things to make sense.In the North, we learn two things that shed more humiliating light to previous goofy scripts: Sansa admits she knew about the teleporting knights of the Vale, but...said nothing...because....uh......uhmm.Also, Davos really didn't know what had happened to Shireen. Which means his complete indifference towards Stannis' fate makes even less sense. The northern banner-men proclaim Jon Snow king in the north (it's getting real easy). After Petyr has told Sansa every decision he makes is towards an end that sees him on the iron throne with Sansa at his side. Even, apparently, giving her to Ramsay Snow. Hooray, said fans who don't care if anything in that story-line ever made any sense.I'll admit I was wrong about Sam - he did reach Oldtown this season. Just quickly enough to ascertain that all this teleporting nonsense is not because a long time passes between scenes, but because Benioff and Weiss really don't have a clue.Lastly. Cersei's coronation was framed as a season finale. But these people are so sick, so deranged, they couldn't resist. They HAD to close in exactly the same way they closed most seasons and a bunch of mid-season episodes. With a scene that's meant to portray their favourite character in epic light. But instead causes explosive diarrhea.I really don't understand who likes the direction the show has taken. Anyone who was watching closely, anyone who was paying attention, whether they read the books or not, can see that there is no coherence, no continuity, no logic left.I understand the conventions of TV shows, but not in this case. It wasn't the way GoT was. Not for a while. If Daenerys sailing west with her buddy Tyrion, Jon being proclaimed king in the north, and Arya taking revenge makes you happy regardless of the fact that for these things to happen you watched a dreadful mess of a show, I'm sorry. You don't deserve what GoT was. You deserve what it has become.",

In fact i had just got spoilers for that before the 7th spider as i presume but it felt terrible. I feel sorry for Tommen Lannister for his miserable death that he truly doesn't deserve. Arya just got he family revenge.\"THE KING IN THE NORTH\"- Jon Snow.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.The seventh, and penultimate, season begins promisingly if also somewhat unsatisfyingly with \"Dragonstone\". After Season 6 finished so mightily with \"The Winds of Winter\", \"Dragonstone\" was somewhat disappointing while still being decent. As far as 'Game of Thrones' season openers go, for me it's not the best or among the best despite the numerous praise from the critics. Instead am siding more with the more divisive (with a good deal of negativity) fan reaction, leaning towards the \"like it with some reservations\" camp. \"Dragonstone\" does well putting things into place, introducing new ideas and characters and doing its best maintaining the intrigue for the existing characters. What it doesn't do so well is the lack of answers and the character and story progression, very little moves forward and can definitely understand the extended filler and uneventful complaint.Other episodes fare much better with the momentum. Most episodes are tight and do so well not feeling over-crowded despite so many characters and plot strands, while also successful in the quieter and more reflective episodes and spectacular action-packed ones. \"Dragonstone\" is not really either of those, and one of the not many 'Game of Thrones' episodes where some of it feels dull due to a couple too many overlong scenes that stretch the momentum too much. This would have been achieved by tightening the Brotherhood scenes and having a little less of Sam.As well as completely cutting Ed Sheeran's cameo, which was completely unnecessary and didn't gel with the rest of the episode at all. In fact, it took me out of the atmosphere completely and had too much of a felt like it came from somewhere else entirely. Euron is also very poorly written here, a real waste of space and some of the episode is on the talky side. However there are things that are very well done here. The highlights being Arya's revenge, Daenerys' homecoming and especially Sandor's atonement. With the character relationships, which 'Game of Thrones' always excels in, Jon and Sansa and Jaime and Cersei come off the most interestingly.Acting, apart from Sheeran and Peter Dinklage is wasted, is generally fine. Though it's not one of the best-acted episodes, with nobody standing out in a tour-De-force way but Rory McCann comes close. Maisie Williams, Kit Harrington and especially Rory McCann (in a powerful performance) come over best.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.There are enough layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing despite all the talk. In summation, promising start but not completely satisfying. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

The pre-credit sequence with Arya and the Freys is pure crowd-pleasing and works very well, severing the ties of the past before getting on with the new sub-plots. These generally work, although there are two significant missteps: the scene with a cameoing Ed Sheeran is excruciating, pure self-indulgence on the part of the showrunners, and only would have worked had Arya gone on a Lannister soldier killing spree. The scenes of Sam at the Citadel are also unnecessary, toilet humour at its worst, as if the vomiting scenes in the last season weren't bad enough. Still, the material with the Hound and the Brotherhood is sensitively handled, and the rest sets the scene for what's to come.",

Winter is here and the final moves to win the \"Game,\" have begun. Being somewhat forgetful and never really studying the series, I'm never really sure who has the advantage. Or does anyone. Are the dragons the final solution? What are the alliances and who will come forward to make the difference. There are supernatural elements that could factor in as well. I am proud of myself. When Arya comes across the soldier who invite her to share their food. I said to myself, \"They've got a guy that looks just like Ed Sheeran.\" I guess they are singing a new song that has just been written.

In the opening scene we see that Arya's revenge against the Freys didn't end with the killing of Walder. Meanwhile her brother Brandon reaches The Wall, warning of the approaching threat while their siblings Jon and Sansa disagree on how to proceed after the defeat on Ramsey Bolton and his forces. Back in King's Landing Cersei, now the Queen, is seeking new allies for the coming fight against Daenerys's forces as well as against the Armies of the North and the Sand Sisters to the south. Elsewhere Sam is trying to find a source of dragon glass and Daenerys finally returns to Westeros.I really enjoyed this episode; it started well with Arya making it abundantly clear that she has lots of people to kill. It then proceeds to remind us what other characters are up to while setting things up for future episodes. The tension between Sansa and Jon hints at possible problems to come and the meeting between Cersei and Euron Greyjoy suggests the possibility of an interesting alliance. Apart from the opening scene there is little in the way of violence; even that involved poison rather than action; that didn't bother me though as the more talky elements served to remind me of the various characters after some time away from the series. I know some people weren't keen with having singer Ed Sheeran appear as a Lannister soldier but it didn't bother me; if I hadn't heard about his appearance before watching I doubt I'd have thought anything of it. As expected the cast are all on fine form and the effects are impressive. Overall a long season opener that immediately brought me back into the story after a gap of almost two years.",

                    "content": "Well, the longest wait in between seasons is finally over. Winter is here and Game of Thrones has returned. Much like most of the season premieres, 'Dragonstone' dealt with a lot of aftermath to last season's events, and a whole lot of set-up for this season. The one thing that separates this season from most is that it seems like the majority of the characters are actually beginning to realize the bigger threat at hand. That is, besides Cersei and Daenerys, they haven't gotten there just yet.Ironically, that's part of what really excites me about this season, though. The inevitable battle for Westeros and battle of wit between Daenerys and Cersei, and how everyone else deals with the army of the dead. Nearly half of the scenes mentioned the Night King or his army in some way shape or form. Of course, Cersei chooses not to associate herself with any of that, even going as far as mentioning every other threat in Westeros besides the white walkers. However, her scene with Jaime was just as interesting anyway. You can tell how torn and worried Jaime is. You can only hope the best for him, even after everything he's been through. And what might this gift be that Euron is offering to give Cersei? It's hard to think of anything she'd want more than Tyrion's head at this point, but I hardly believe that will be the outcome. Instead, I think it will be something or someone we haven't seen in quite some time. I tend to believe that Gendry Baratheon theory the more and more I think about it.In the North, we had a few important but predictable things happen. We had heard that there would still be some (unnecessary) tension between Sansa and Jon, well that was definitely the case. Isn't it about time Sansa trusts Jon's way of things? I get it, she's trying to warn Jon about being too honorable, something that got Robb and Ned killed. But there's something to be said for 2 family members on this show not arguing their way to an unpleasant death, am I right? Elsewhere at The Wall, Bran and Meera were let in after convincing Ed that he's the three-eyed raven and he knows everything. How long until Jon meets back up with Bran?Speaking of Starks, perhaps the person with the most memorable moments of the episode was Arya's 'Red Wedding Redemption' at Riverrun. I can't believe I'm saying this, but if it took spending 2 seasons at The House of Black and White for Arya to produce great scene after great scene, then I think it was all worth it. A reverse Red Wedding was exactly the cold open we needed, once again proving that George RR Martin can be good to the Starks after all. I was a little bit surprised to not see her immediately kill those Lannister soldier's, but I guess it was done to show us that there's still a little bit left of innocent Arya in her.There was a lot of Sam in this episode, perhaps too much. Check that, there was definitely too much screen time for Sam. It's not that I don't like his character, but I just don't see the reason behind wasting valuable time on something that could be sped by in a minute or two. He may have found the key to defeating the white walkers, and we found out Jorah isn't doing so well and spending time at the Citadel being partially taken care of by Sam himself. Cool to see Jorah, but man those scenes with Sam were crappy (for the most part). But, Seriously though.The last few bits included The Hound finding his way back to the house him and Arya stayed in a few seasons back, and Daenerys finding her way home. Both very different 'homecomings', but both very emotionally resonant scenes nonetheless. There isn't necessarily a parallel to be drawn between the two, but it's very interesting to think about how far those 2 characters in particular have come since the opening episode of the series. I love seeing The Hound in a different light, one that's less bloody and far more forgiving, and Daenerys is certainly at her most powerful after reaching her home. And that was about it for a first episode. Certainly an impressive opening, albeit not as surprising as last year's Melisandre shocker. It's annoying to think we only have 6 more weeks of this, but it will have to do for now. I'm 100% sure that the rest of the season will be top-quality Thrones.+Recap & set-up+Daenerys reaches home+Jaime is torn+Arya's redemption+The Hound's transformation-Sam cleaning up crap8.3/10",

The show runners showed us the vast and interesting universe of GOT and how almost every character in this show has added value and intrigue to the show. While we start to build up to epic moments in the season it is nice to see the lives and stories of other characters. Jon Snow and Cersei had acknowledged each others existence and positions as well as being aware of Daenerys. Some scenes stood out such as Daenerys arrived at Dragonstone and felt the sand and the scene with the Wight Walkers marching forward and not a single word was needed to capture its intensity. A truly great start that is gearing up to some significant events.",

I specifically loved that Sam funny moments in the citadel cleaning sh!t and body parts, LOL. Ed Sheeren's appearance was meh, i mean it wasn't bad but it was a one line episodic, the whole thing probably was to make the premiere has more views than the past ones and i think it all worked fine.Three or four long scenes for the Hound \"Clegane\" and Sam alone which means they'll be one of the core characters this season.The new sets, cloths, makeup and the cinematography are as always at their best.The plot is at it's peak , George RR Martin has done such a magnificent job past year and i think it'll all pay off with a record number of ratings and views.And for a final touch up, a premiere wouldn't be perfect without a Mother of Dragons legendary entrance to her homeland and sitting on her father's old throne and \"Shall we begin\".The whole cast are still engaging and after living the story for 7 years you wouldn't even imagine a better performance.So as always I can not wait for the next 9 hours.",

                    "content": "After being impressed by how impressive the sixth season of Game of Thrones was when it continued the character arcs for the surviving Stark and Lannister family members and the writing was as strong as the previous five seasons (despite one episode in season 5 that I considered to be my least favorite, Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken even though it was decent). Anyway, when I saw the first episode of the seventh season last summer in order to catch up with the series finale coming in 2019, it lived up to my expectations and it became a great start. The reason why I'm giving this a 9/10 is because the only quibble that I have with Dragonstone is that while it was great to see Ed Sheeran and the other song artists Will Champion, the drummer from Coldplay and Gary Lightbody from Snow Patrol playing Lannister soldiers and sharing a scene with Maisie Williams, they only appeared for four minutes. I mean, after they sang that song together, I was expecting them to have more screen time in the seventh season, but sadly, they didn't. What a shame.Anyway, the rest of the episode is solid. The storyline continues to be exquisite much like the previous six seasons and continues to up the ante with the relationships. Not only that, there are some great scenes that made it worthwhile to other viewers. Arya disguising herself as Walder Frey and having her revenge on the House of Frey for killing her mother Catelyn Stark and her brother Robb Stark by killing them, Sandor Clegane, who survived his wounds after the fourth and sixth seasons and having to atone for his old life of working with the House of Lannister, and Daenerys's dramatic homecoming to Dragonstone. Those sequences are amazing and another perfect example of well-paced and atmospheric filming which makes them on par with The Red Wedding, the Execution of Eddard Stark, the destruction of the Great Sept, and more. Ramin Djawadi continues to create more excellent music for his score for this season. It fitted the scenes really well as well as retaining the scale and scope of the production designs, which are still as gorgeous and before. The editing is sharp, the pacing didn't drag, and the acting continues to be strong with the best coming from Maisie Williams, Kit Harrington, Sophie Turner, and Emilia Clarke.Overall, Dragonstone delivered what it promised. It showed the characters trying to make an army to they can begin the war against the White Walkers while continuing the depth and development. This deserves a thumbs up from me. :)",

Last night was no exception \u2014 the exchange between Littlefinger (Aidan Gillen) and Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner), for example, was priceless.The glimpse of The Night King's wight army, however brief, should please any horror fan.

If the leaked script for Season 7 is accurate, then the bad guys in the final episode ought to be damned frightening.I will reiterate a very minor longstanding quibble that I have had with \"Game of Thrones\" as someone who has not read the books. This story seems to attach tremendous dramatic emphasis to the movement and arrival of groups of people. I do understand the need for this, and its appeal \u2014 the logistics are part of George R.R. Martin's world- building, and they bring detail and a sense of realism. There are times, however, when I feel like Daenerys' defining character trait is that she \u0085 goes places. (Look! Now her army is here!)I won't say much more for fear of spoilers \u2014 this is a show where even mentioning a character's name can suggest a chapter in his or her character arc.

I think the episode could have shown some more things, this episode could have been made a little more interesting. It's just that maybe the director and writer decided to keep the last episode to this point. This episode captures the moment when someone returns to the house where his family was destroyed, the moment when those moments come before his eyes again. To defeat the devil, you have to take the help of the devil. That may have been tried very well in this episode. The episode also explains what it feels like when the dream world is not what the dream world is like. And in this episode we will see my favorite singer in a small character. Sometimes people tell an extreme truth with a smile on their face but people don't want to believe it and sometimes when they tell a lie very truthfully they believe it immediately. A small incident on this subject is shown in the episode. All human beings have the right to return to their ancestors after death, a right that is stated in the Epistle. It may not be possible to die with the Queen's orders. This episode is a bit slow, that's fine, but without this episode, the stories of the next episode will be incomplete.",

Coming off an epic conclusion to season 6, I've been really excited to jump back into the world of Westeros and see what it can deliver.I felt like that this season premier was always going to have a tough job. Not only was this the biggest break between seasons the show has ever had, but for me, these last 2 season play as a sort of 'final act' to the story. I needed this episode to just be a solid welcome back. I didn't need it to have a massive battle or big key moments, I just needed it to give me a reminder as to what is going on, where everyone is, who is with who, as well as start to show a bit of direction as to where this story is head. And I'm pleased to say this episode did that for me.This premiere did a wonderful job at reintroducing me to where everyone is at. Considering I did get around to rewatching season 6 in preparation, it was good that they eased us back into the story while still showing that time has progressed while we have been away. I found that the main reason this was done so well was the amount of time spent with each person/major group. I never felt like we dwelled too much time on someone story, and each person/group we visited, we can take something away from it. I would say however the only group we didn't get much time with was Daenarys, which I was fine with because their scene was so impactful and meaningful for the future of the season.Despite not much happening however, there was one major thing that I have to touch on because it was my favourite part of the episode, and that was Arya taking out the room in the beginning. I've enjoyed Arya's story for the most part over the past few seasons however it has often felt like it's own contained story that doesn't touch too much on everything else that is happening. This changed this episode. Arya has always been about revenge however this for me was the first impactful revenge act she has done which really shows that she is now a force. She is heading for Kings Landing and after that display, I felt like she finally could leave a trademark in this fight for the throne.There is something else I need to address about this episode and that is Ed Sheeran. I am all good for celebrity cameos and all that good stuff, but I don't think this fit at all. Firstly the singing threw me out because he has such a recognisable voice that it felt out of place. Secondly, I don't think they have written a more awkward character. Arya sits right next to him however he looks like a scared boy that has never spoken to a girl. If they wrote him in a way where he says a couple of line but is mainly a background character, then I think it would of worked fine. However because he was so front and centre, there was too much focus on him for what very little he actually contributed.Overall, rating this episode is hard. If I rate it as a premier episode and how well it did everything I wanted it to, it's a near perfect rating, however, in the context of the rating of other episode, while it was still overall solid, I know it is an episode that will fall off my radar in a few weeks.8/10",

                    "content": "Arguably, I should have stopped watching the show two years ago, but peer pressure keeps me going - and to be honest, I do enjoy bashing it. Nonetheless, I try to be as fair in my judgment as my disappointment with its course can allow.Which is why I can and will recognise there were a few good things in this seventh season premiere. Sandor is the one character I still very much enjoy, and his scenes were probably the highlight of the episode. Sam's adventures in Oldtown were also interesting, despite two alarming signals: 1) I know teleportation is by now the standard method of travel in the series, but how did Jorah end up there? 2) dragonglass mine in Dragonstone - have to tell Jon - precursor of meeting that will make me throw up, argh. Meanwhile, in King's Landing, after reinforcing the view that Cersei has simply become a completely different character for no justifiable reason (going from \"lioness protecting her cubs\" to \"meh, never cared for these brats anyway\" is not a shift that can be excused by any trauma or whatnot, it's simply terrible storytelling), we see that Jaime doesn't seem to care all that much that all his children are dead either. I mean, he cared when Joffrey died despite recognising he's a monster, but who cares about losing the good kids, right? Other than that, the alliance with Euron is, I will cede, a sensible move, but Euron's portrayal remains poor - don't know if it's due to him being completely unlike the book version or because he does, as I read somewhere, seem to be a copy of Vikings' Floki, but he's very meh.Elsewhere, Arya's adventures in the Marvel Universe continue, as the show treats her as some kind of Westerosi Mystique. The opening scene was supposed to be some sort of reverse Red Wedding to provide closure, but it was so sloppy, uninteresting and naive, derivative to the point that it seemed like they just wanted to get it over with quickly - now that I think about it, the scene's lack of quality does make it the reverse of the Red Wedding. In her other appearance, Arya meets a group of laughably kind-hearted Lannister soldiers, put there to tell the audience in huge, simple font, that \"people who fight for the Lannisters are not necessarily bad guys\". Because, and that is the crux of the show's faltering course, more and more it becomes a show of good and bad guys, when the absence of such clear dualism is the story's most interesting quality, plot- wise.Up to the North, Brandon and Meera reach the Wall but we are never told how they survived - Hodor held the door, but not for that long and they weren't 10 minutes away. Well. Not as bad as escaping by ship and ending up on the wrong side of the Wall at the exact middle of the continent, but unless I am forgetting a scene from last season, inexplicable. At Castle Black, Jon makes some decisions which are better than Sansa's ideas, but it's still pretty silly to see how half the most important Houses of the region are all in the hands of toddlers. The intricacy of how many loyal Umbers and even Karstarks remain is lost in the series which appears to recognise at most two heirs at each House, but this simplification is understandable so I won't hold it against them. I will say I have begun to find the little Mormont girl annoying, but that's probably due to me needing things to annoy me in the show.And speaking of annoying things, we reach the end, where Annoying McStupidface Daenerys has the nerves to set foot on Dragonstone (completely empty because...I don't know) and take down Stannis' banner with that smug, irritating \"they took my burger\" look, while her troupe of suddenly braindead advisers stare with awe at her. Because gods forbid that they end an episode without centering around her Uselessness.On the plus side, we didn't have to suffer through any Sand Snakes dialogue.",

My main problem was that barely anything actually happened. The best moment of the episode is at the very beginning. Before the title sequence even. Everything else was just so long and drawn out. They could have easily covered all of this in half the time. There is a scene between Arya and some random soldiers. It takes at least 5 mins and it seems like its only purpose is to give Ed Sheeran a cameo. There is another scene with the Hound that goes on way too long. I love this show so much, but, things are not off to a good start. Tyrion didn't even say one word this episode. With only 7 episodes this season I was hoping for twice as much action in half the time, not half as much action in twice the time. Get it together GOT. This could be the greatest TV show of all time. To let it all fall apart in the final season would be tragic.",

                    "content": "'Dragonstone' has to be the best first episode of Game of Thrones since season 4, it is filled with so many breathtaking scenes that the writers nailed right on the head. We are well ahead of the books now, so the writers are coming up with their own tale, and they are doing a great job at keeping up with the style of George R. R Martins books, without betraying the source material. Now I have read some of the ridiculous bad reviews from the fools in the review section, but these are probably just whiny little kids you just want everything to follow the books to a tee. Dragonstone starts off with a great opening, tying up loose ends and showing us again how badass Arya is. However I do hope they don't overpower her too much. The scenes in the North were also brilliant, and I loved how Sansa questioned Jon about his decisions, and the scene plays out in a way that you can understand where both characters are coming from. Oh and please show us more Tormund and Brienne, they are just perfect for the much needed comedy. The scenes at Kings Landing were good, nothing very important happens, other than Jamie being roasted, which was hilarious. I do hope however, that they make Euron as savage as he is in the books. There is next to nothing wrong with this episode other than, one small issue. Ed Sheering. While I am a fan of his, he was so out of place here, and it took away from the immersion of the rather great scene he was in. Now it would have been better if he was less recognisable - maybe dressed in a long wig with a shaggy beard or even a patch over his eye, to make him less - Ed. The scene was great, as it showed Arya that not all Lannister soldiers are rapists and murderers. But the best part of this episode, is by far the scenes with the Hound and the Brotherhood. The Hound is my favourite Game of Thrones character, and seeing him back in his full glory was incredible. His care-free attitude makes him one of the most interesting characters to watch, and I can't wait to see him roast more people for being bald.Sam's scenes were great, I loved how they edited it all together, to make you gag and laugh all at the same time. Dragonstone was a brilliant episode, that sets up the next episodes perfectly. Now that were are way past the books, I am more than eager to be surprised and not have anything spoiled by idiots on the internet. 9.6/10",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Up to this very early point of 'Game of Thrones' penultimate season, my initial impression of Season 7 has been decent and promising but not completely satisfying. It is the season that settled the least quickly in my mind and it is not hard to see some of the disappointment with fans. The season opener \"Dragonstone\" epitomised the above, while \"Stormborn\" makes improvements but there are signs of the promising but not entirely satisfying feel of the start of Season 7. Can see the high critical praise, but am somewhere in the high middle of the very divisive fan reaction.\"Stormborn\", while not quite sending up a storm as much as ought, does improve upon \"Dragonstone\". Things continue to be introduced, set up and put into place while there is enough intrigue to the existing characters and stories. Compared to \"Dragonstone\", \"Stormborn\" is far more eventful, has more tension in the character relationships, progresses characters (especially Arya) and storylines better, most scenes here serve far more of a point and don't feel like overlong padding and there are no misplaced or jarring cameos. At the same time, \"Stormborn\" did feel on the rushed side. If the pace had slowed down, character motivations would have been clearer and the character writing much more consistent. Euron, who continues to be written poorly, especially is inconsistent and doesn't make sense, and Yara and Ellania fare little better. The intimate scene between Grey Worm and Missandrei was drawn out and unnecessary, the only scene that felt like filler, and some of the writing doesn't flow very naturally and is uncharacteristically corny. Luckily, there are some great scenes, conflicts and characterisation to balance out what didn't work. The Arya, Daenerys and Dragonstone scenes are beautifully done, as are the chemistry between Daenerys and Jon and Tyrion and Littlefinger being as ever awesome. Another highlight is the exciting, affecting and gorgeously filmed climactic action sequence.In terms of acting, \"Stormborn\" is solid. There aren't any tour-De-force performances or especially outstanding ones, but nobody is terrible either. Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke, Aidan Gillen, Kit Harrington and Peter Dinklage come off strongest. That for Euron is the weak link, but much of it is down to how Euron is written which would be beneath any actor.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Enough layers, passion and sensitivity in the writing, even if they don't come consistently.Summing up, decent episode but as 'Game of Thrones' has done so many masterpiece part of me couldn't help feeling disappointed. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

Suddenly this all feels very Hollywood-ised, nowhere more obvious than in the climactic sea battle which feels rushed and incoherent. We're supposed to believe that an entire fleet of ships is snuck up on and overwhelmed in the space of five minutes, when in reality such a sea battle would last a day at least. There's a fight scene with sloppy, choppy, shaky-cam choreography totally unlike the carefully-crafted battles found elsewhere in the show. Plus you have the cheesy one-liners like \"Come and give your uncle a kiss!\". What were they thinking? Elsewhere, there's some good stuff with Jon, Jorah and Daenerys, but the scenes with Arya are off and Maisie Williams feels unsure of herself, acting suddenly out of character. STORMBORN is an episode that feels like it belongs to another show.",

I still need a scorecard to keep track of the alliances and, really, the endgame. The iron throne is the prize, but then what? Arya is more and more interesting and Theon once again has no punch left in him. Jon is off to meet with Dani and this really sets up the Super Bowl.",

In Kings Landing, Cersei tries to gather allied to fight Daenerys and Qyburn shows a powerful weapon to kill dragons he has developed. Meanwhile Jon Snow decides to accept the invitation of Daenerys expecting to convince her to use her dragons and the dragon glass in her land to destroy the White Walkers. Arya learns that Jon Snow is the King of the North and decides to return to Winterfells and has an unexpected encounter. Samwell tries to secretly heal Jorah from the greyscale risking his career. Yara Greyjoy and Eliaria are navigating the Narrow Sea when they are surprisingly attacked by Euron and his fleet. \"Stormborn\" is a great episode of \"Game of Thrones\" with good segments and surprising conclusion. Now the strategies are discussed by the opponents with their allied and the war is close. Most of the characters have great participation and the viewers will certainly anxiously looking forward to see the sequel. My vote is nine.Title (Brail): \"Stormborn\"",

They won't be enough though so Daenerys sends a message inviting John Snow to join her forces. He is cautioned against this by Sansa and other northern leaders but feels he must go when he learns there is dragon glass under her castle; something that will be needed if they are to defeat the threat from the north. Elsewhere Arya meets an old friend and learns that the Starks once again control Winterfell and Sam risks his position to try to save Jorah Mormont. Finally Yara's fleet is ambushed and she must face her uncle.I enjoyed the season opener but thought this was even better. We continue to learn more about various alliances and plans for the upcoming war but more importantly we get a really exciting seaborne battle where characters fight aboard burning ships at night. As is often the case there are questions of trust; notably whether it will be safe for John to go to Daenerys given her family's history. The episode gives us some nice character progression as Arya changes plans when she hears the news of Winterfell and John leaving Sansa in charge when he prepares to visit Daenerys. The cast does a fine job throughout and the effects are impressive, especially during the battle scene. Overall a fine combination of character development, plot advancement and action.",

Of course, next week that excitement will likely be amplified when they do meet, but there's something so satisfying about a little bit of dialogue from both sides about each other. The best part about it is that the meeting actually makes a ton of sense logistically. It's not like the show is forcing the meeting for the heck of it to improve ratings, Jon & Daenerys are a combination people have been wanting for years, and the showrunners waited for just the right time. Luckily, that wasn't the only great development this week.After being so set on going to King's Landing to kill Cersei, Arya had a change of heart tonight and decided to head back home to Winterfell. It's weird to think that she had no idea what was going on in the North and Jon Snow's victory at the Battle of the Bastards. Her reunion with Hot Pie was a really nice moment because they haven't seen each other in years, but mostly because of Maisie Williams' performance. She barely had to say any words to know exactly how she felt when hearing her brother Jon took back the North. Can't wait to see her head back to her home and *fingers crossed* actually see Jon and Sansa. We all know this show has a frustrating history of ripping the rug out from under us more than once. Coupling those scenes with Arya's bittersweet reunion with Nymeria, and Maisie had one heck of a week. Again, it's not like this show just threw in that scene to excite fans, it makes sense thematically with what Arya is going through. Nymeria naturally won't go with Arya because she has already found her home with other wolves, just like Arya returning to her home in Winterfell because that's where she belongs.Back to the Jon & Daenerys front, it really seems like both are struggling with the power hierarchy in their respected circles. On one hand, Dany's discussion at Dragonstone with Yara, Varys, Tyrion, Olenna, Ellaria, and others, shows just how far she still is from conquering. Though, if she follows what Olenna said, perhaps that conquering will be sooner than expected. Jon is dealing with some tough feedback from his North men and women as well. Ultimately though, he made his decision to head to Dragonstone and leave Winterfell with Sansa. Will this lead to Sansa getting rid of Littlefinger once and for all? Or perhaps more likely, give Littlefinger the wiggle room to manipulate Sansa one last time.There wasn't a ton of Cersei material this week, but she did apparently figure out a way to \"kill\" a dragon. The dragon size crossbow is interesting, but sure isn't as shocking as the wildfire she brought out last year. Not that it wasn't a possibility already, but I have to believe one of the dragons will fall by season's end. The playing field has to be leveled a little bit, right? Well, I guess it already was by having Euron take down a bunch of Greyjoy ships, the sand snakes, and capture Ellaria. Boy was it depressing to see Theon once again fail under pressure as it becomes all the more likely Yara won't make it out of this season alive.Some other tidbits worth mentioning; Jorah's health is looking better! I don't like spending time at the Citadel, it's become pretty annoying at this point. But if Sam cures Jorah, I'll be a happy man. Jon pinning Littlefinger up against the wall was awesome. It sure doesn't look like Jaime will be switching sides (like I hoped) anytime soon. I really hate seeing Jon & Dany constantly being undermined. This may be the first episode where every scene essentially boiled down to the same conflict. No fillers this year. Finally, hearing Dany say \"He sounds like quite a man\" about Jon Snow, pretty much rattled every bone in my body. So many thoughts. The Prince Who Was Promised prophecy finally taking shape!+Dany & Jon parallels+Surprised by the Euron battle+Arya's decision/reunions+So much progression, no filler scenes9.2/10",

The idea behind 7 episodes in this season isn't good for a whole story i think, because story now has to progress in a \"fast pace mode\" when seeing some characters emerge from one point to another very fast. But that is a small issue so far. After this episode i really look forward for a next one, where probably two major characters will finally meet - hope for a great screenplay there. As for this episode, it was excellently paced with production values as great as always. Overall, with only 5 episodes left (already?) i do look forward for them to come ASAP.",

I don't want it to end too soon! This show has EASILY been the best thing on air since Breaking Bad finished its run four years ago; and Game of Thrones still delivers amazing out-of-this-world experiences through its AMAZING cast of characters and cinema-esque direction. Stormborn is great. Tyrion is here, Daenerys is here, Jon Snow is still the best 'Snow' who's ever lived; and Littlefinger is STILL a creepy and power-hungry bastard craving The Iron Throne with Sansa by his side.Ellaria Sand has lost her daughters in this episode, Theon Greyjoy has TRULY lost his balls this time as he lets his Uncle Euron take her hostage after they have a disastrous battle out at sea resulting in both sides suffering heavy losses. This episode ended on a shockingly cruel and bloody note; Theon decided to jump ship and escape Euron leaving him to keep Yara as prisoner. Theon has proved once and for all that he is completely broken. Theon really did lose his old-self when Ramsay tortured him. I hope either Theon or Yara get their revenge and KILL Euron Greyjoy!Game of Thrones is not hurrying itself, though it is trying its best to kill off our favourite characters one episode at a time. I'm personally worried for Tyrion; is he even gonna make it through Season Eight at this point?!",

It uses strategic discussion perfectly as the characters continue to prepare themselves for war. The story continues to be well-written, the pacing is well done, the directing and editing continues to be solid, Ramon Djawadi continues to shine creating more beautiful music and the characters are still compelling. The moments involving them are also compelling including Daenerys arranging her army in Dragonstone, Arya reuniting with her direwolf Nymeria, and a great action sequence to end the episode. Overall, this is an even solid episode and the best was yet to come in the later episodes. Thumbs up. :)",

Last week's season premiere did what I needed it to in reintroducing us back into this world while giving us nuggets for the season going forward.This week they started getting into the meat of this season. Without going too much into detail of what happened, \u00a0they started to turn a lot of those big cogs in the wheel which are going to see this season be so much different to previous ones. As mentioned last week, for me this is the start of the end of Game of Thrones, and what I want that to mean is that for so long everyone has been so spread out across the kingdoms, that now it is time for them to come together and face off once and for all. This season started that for me and I'm really looking forward to where they are heading.Something that really stood out for me this episode was the way it was shot and edited. While I always notice this stuff, some of my favourite moments from this episode was just how something was shot or edited. Again without giving too much away, there is a shot of a certain ship appearing and the way it is shot brings so much fear with it.Along with all our groups slowly coming together, we are starting to see new relationship and interactions with our characters. For me this is a big thing because for so long we have wondered what would happen if this person met this person and we are finally getting to see it. There was also some other interactions with characters that I never knew I wanted until this episode.Overall, a fantastic episode of Game of Thrones. While we are still in the quiet part of the season, we are starting to build towards the end. It's hard to think that after next week we will basically be at the half way mark of the season. However, despite that, all the ingredients seem to be there for a fantastic season.9/10",

                    "content": "When I learned the title of the episode I braced myself for impact, expecting to be writing a review raving about Hitlaerys Sturmborn and how much I despise her, but I was wrong. Because fortunately, there was not so much Daenerys in the episode and it was in fact quite enjoyable, for the much lowered standards of the series post late-fifth season. The lowered standards will hopefully become evident as we delve deeper into this, I repeat, rather good episode (more a 7 than a 6 but I will not indulge).Now, we know that Daenerys is D&D's favourite, to the point of endless streams of vomit. They've taken a character who is well meaning, but behaves like (and, in fact, is) a stubborn child who doesn't listen to anyone and turned her into a (supposedly) wise ruler who heeds all the different counsel by her advisers before contemplating a decision. However, in this case, this didn't bother me - even if I don't see how Daenerys suddenly remembered to be suspicious of Varys, or appreciate how Melissandre is reduced to some kind of plot device, I was, after a long time, not annoyed by the Daenerys scenes. Buuuuut. Here's the thing. You have to see how there is zero surprise in the plot. Even when it's not full of holes, it's just obvious and fan-pampering. An alliance is proposed between Daenerys and Jon Snow! Really? I am not sure if Jon will actually go himself (I suspect he may end up sending Davos because he has to do something), but an auto-pilot script is not what this show became known for. And you know what, I do not expect you to be as good at it as GRRM, but since you are nowhere near the actual plot by now, can't you at least try to be unpredictable?The same goes for Sam - I really liked the Oldtown scenes, but the whole thing was Lessons in Clich\u00e9 1.01. Senior wise man says there is no cure. Novice claims there is one, but senior dismisses it as \"too dangerous\". Novice tries it anyway, successfully (OK, not certain yet, let's say \"with at least temporary success\"). Of course, no sign of \"danger\" actually appears, and if a guy who's just enrolled can do it, it becomes all the sillier.Then you have King's Landing: Cersei keeps searching for allies and Jaime convinces Lord Tarly to help them - and OK, his argument against maintaining allegiance to house Tyrell is half-convincing, but you know, she just murdered Lord Tyrell, the Queen, the head of the church, and a bunch of other nobles, and Jaime is like \"you should totally trust us, not the other guys\". There is zero reason for any noble family to support Cersei. Hell, there is zero reason why Jaime hasn't already abandoned her. Oh, and by the way, Cersei's wizard-necromancer is working on a solution how to kill dragons. It's a ballista. At first I thought, \"yep, undead bone-dragon, that's a bit outrageous but cool\", but no, it was a big crossbow.In the North, I'll ignore the Daenerys summons discussion, and focus on how terribly ungrateful everyone is to Lord Baelish. Seriously, dudes. You are all horrible human beings for no reason at all - oh wait, not for no reason, it is so Petyr will eventually turn against them, right? Yeah, very subtle. Of course, someone is already saying \"but he gave Sansa to Ramsay!\", and yes, sure, but 1. Sansa also thought 'yeah, I'm not certain, but it doesn't sound like the worst idea ever' 2. this idea actually was the worst ever, and the stupidest plot of the entire show, so I would expect them to try and make the audience forget about it.......much like they did with Dorne. The show, having butchered the Dorne story-line beyond recognition, having reduced Doran Martell and Aryo Hotah to a couple of background extras who get murdered having taken no part in the story, having turned the Sandsnakes into a joke about \"worst dialogues in the history of television\", decides to put this poor abomination out of its misery. Well, Ellaria and one of her daughters may have survived to one day remind us of the Dornish trainwreck (gift to Cersei I guess), but the rest of them are dispensed with quickly, after sharing one last really cringe-worthy exchange, discussing how many Lannisters each one will kill in King's Landing...the battle that leads to this purge is cool enough, I liked Theon's reversal back to Reek, but, yet again, it's not all too surprising is it? Daenerys has been given everything by the show. The Lannisters have next to nothing, so Euron has to be elevated to super-villain status to provide some semblance of suspense. So who of the Daenerys allies will they get rid of? The ones they have mutilated the most (the Martells), and the Greyjoys, who are not too well- loved.So all in all, a good episode, which serves to remind us the woes of lacking your source of inspiration.",

She was told about the man: she or Tyrion should have thought of it.We also see her threading the complex politics. Who can she trust.Jon Snow once again shows his quality, by being ready to risk his own life by putting himself into the power of Daenerys, whom he knows very little about.Then there is Arya. We learn she did not know that the Starks were at Winterfell. And see her turn back, meaning that both she and Cersei last for a few episodes more and perhaps into Season 8.Her meeting her direwolf Nymeria was always to be expected. And it is not so odd that she does not immediately win her back. This sets it up for the direwolf to appear and save her when all else is lost, maybe.Or maybe not. The wolf is suspicious - convinced enough to not attack her, but doubtful. And when it departs, 'Arya' says \"That's not you\".There has long been a fan theory that actually The Waif killed Arya and has now taken over her identity, presumably with the approval of the Faceless Men. That would make sense. The apparent removal of the Waif's face could be a necessary extra, or perhaps it was always borrowed.If so, one would expect her to fool most people. The magic must include memories of things that Arya would not have mentioned to anyone. And we might expect Bran, last seen at the wall, to be the person who sees through her.",

Everything you want from Game of Thrones.The episode opens with a brilliantly shot scene, and shows us something that has been on my mind since season 5. Why would Dany trust the Spider? This episode explains that, and shows us one of Vary's best speeches ever. The scenes with Arya were some of the best, she hasn't been the stand out character in some while, and seeing her interact with her long lost wolf was a brilliant scene. And can I just point how fantastic the effects on the Direwolves has come along.King's Landing was the same as always, plotting and scheming, with a rather thrilling scene that takes place under the Red Keep. I do hope they don't use those giant ballistas.I would say the North scenes weren't the best this episode, they were just good. I did love Jon getting right into Littlefinger's face. About time someone didn't take his sh**. But a part of me thinks that was a mistake on Jon's part.Now for the part everyone is talking about, the battle. While this scene is visually breathtaking, it was a little underwhelming - while still entertaining. My only issue is how short it was, and how shaky the camera was. I made me feel dizzy at times. But we finally got to see the savage side to Euron! That guy is a monster, I watching him with the feeling that he did not care who he was cutting down. But that battle was still good, even better when we saw the deaths of annoying characters that fans have not been overly fond of. And f**k you Theon you damn coward.Stormborn was really good, with maybe one awkward scene - I think some who have watched it know what I'm talking about. 9.4/10",

Finally allowed to speak more than three words, her first real conversation comes in the form of an interrogation of Varys, bringing to light a part of the show's history perhaps we'd all forgotten. Varys is almost renowned for abandoning his leaders when he stops agreeing with them, double crossing them and venturing to the other side of the battle. What's to say he won't just do the same whenever Dany doesn't see eye to eye with him? It's a riveting scene - even more so for the way Dany shuts Tyrion out when he tries to diffuse the tension, this isn't his moment - and Emilia Clarke and Conleth Hill act the hell out of it. I'd comfortably label it the pair's strongest dialogue led scene in a very long time, the kind of focused, verbal sparring match Game of Thrones used to excel at but now rarely indulges in. It was great to have that back again.There's also the undeniable thrill of seeing so many characters in the same scene. Check out the occupants of Dragonstone's war room: Dany, Tyrion, Varys, Grey Worm, Missandei, Olenna, Theon, Yara and Ellaria. Even just seeing them together feels like momentum, so to have them strategising over their plans to invade King's Landing is exciting in all the ways last week's premiere wasn't. Characters are plotting their course, they're talking about what they're going to and, in a rare success for Game of Thrones, it feels legitimately thrilling. There's a certain flair to Mark Mylod's direction in the Dragonstone war room, the way the camera cuts to so many faces, picking up so many reactions. It would've been very easy for an episode like this to slip back into mundanity and feel like more place holding, but instead it feels momentous.While Dany looks into the past to question Varys, Cersei thinks back to the previous Targaryen ruling of King's Landing to help her prepare for the upcoming war. After a mixed bag of an attempt to rally supporting houses to her side, she retreats to a dungeon under the city with Qyburn to discover his latest, dragon-killing weapon. Again, Mylod's direction here is stunning. Cersei stands next to the skeletal remains of the Mad King's biggest dragon, her whole body not even reaching the height of its skull. As well as giving Cersei and the Lannisters a kind of back up defence and helping to even the playing field, it works as foreshadowing - is this the size Drogon will be by the time Dany attacks? Will we get a similar shot of Cersei standing by his freshly killed head? There's something about this sequence that oozes suggestion and warning, a very one-sided war is starting to look more balanced.This idea of reflecting on the past to assist the future crops up elsewhere, too. Sam helps to treat Jorah's greyscale out of respect for his father, who he served during his tenure at the Night's Watch. The scene is annoyingly played for humour again - Sam is more than comic relief, guys - but it connects with the rest of the episode far better than his time last week did. When Jon receives a raven from Tyrion inviting him to Dragonstone, it's his fond memory of Tyrion that helps him overlook the idea that it could be a trap. We know that it isn't, of course, but it's nice to see characters in Game of Thrones take precautions again. This is a war, after all, Sansa is right to be cautious. Jon leaves anyway, sided with Davos, and makes his way for Dragonstone in what could lead to the most exciting character meet the show has offered yet.Perhaps the episode's biggest surprise comes in the form of Arya Stark, though. A character I had already written off as lost after last week's dire attempts at moving her forward, Arya undergoes a serious course correction here. Her first scene with Hot Pie is jarring in that, yet again, she feels like an entirely different character - something the show could be exploring cleverly, yet isn't - but it's saved by its ending with Arya learning that her brother has reclaimed the North. She decides to go there instead, temporarily (I think?) abandoning her plan of killing Cersei, but soon runs into Nymeria, her old Direwolf whom she forced to flee back in season one. As Arya stares into her eyes, the wolf eventually leaves again, but this has left Arya with a sense of optimism - the moment she learns she has family remaining, her previous companion returns to her side, even if only for a moment. I stand corrected, there's hope for the youngest Stark girl yet.\"Stormborn\" eventually concludes with the Greyjoy fleet coming under attack by Euron, and it doesn't quite stick the landing. The battle is too sudden, not pulling off the same shock effect as the sensational \"Hardhome\" did back in season five. The action is supposed to come across as frantic and unorganised, and this is reflected in the editing and direction, but it doesn't make for a particularly thrilling sequence. There's too much going on over too small an environment, leading to a mess of small moments that fail to coalesce into one larger whole. Still, what the battle represents for the show's future is enticing enough for the sloppy execution to be forgiven. Dany had her plan set out, and she won over her council. Now, she's lost her biggest fleet and can't connect with one of her most useful armies. Remember I said this one-sided battle was starting to even out? Game of Thrones seemed to be falling into a predictable route to its endgame, but \"Stormborn\" lands as a jolt to the system, both acknowledging the past and shaking up the future. More like this, please.",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.While mostly liking \"Dragonstone\" and \"Stormborn\", the previous episodes of Season 7, they were of the \"starting the season promisingly and decently but not entirely satisfyingly\" kind. \"The Queen's Justice\" is quite a big improvement, and definitely one of Season 7's better episodes as can be seen by it being one of the best-received episodes of the season. It may not be 'Game of Thrones' at its very best or quite prime 'Game of Thrones', but it very nearly is.\"The Queen's Justice\" starts off a little too slowly perhaps and Euron is still not particularly well written. It is well worth the watch however for a lot of things. The Jon and Daenerys scenes have a lot of passion and intensity, there is a lot of tension and emotion and the climactic scenes are just riveting and sees a great character go out in style. In an episode that largely is a perfect mix of intricate character writing and interaction and pointed action.It follows on from the previous two episodes setting things and putting it all into place, and expands on them and even more. Things are more eventful than before, more intricate, have more tension in the character relationships, characters and storylines show better progression, there's very little if at all padding and nothing really jars. All the acting is on point, with Diana Rigg in particular giving the season's first proper tour-De-force performance.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Layers, passion and sensitivity galore in the writing as well. The characters are very compellingly written and the interaction is handled intelligently. Most of the episode is very well paced and tight when it gets going. Overall, great. 9/10 Bethany Cox",

Euron is a real detraction in this episode and feels more like a hyperactive schoolboy than a supposed series villain. On the plus side, Diana Rigg's final scene is a good 'un and it's nice to finally tie up the Dorne sub-plot in a typically grim way. Excellent production values and some good interplay from Daenerys make this all worthwhile.",

John is the King of the North, while Dany is already assuming rulership of all seven kingdoms. If alliances are to be formed, someone will have to flinch and it doesn't look like it will happen for the time being. We cut to Cersei and we see her at her most powerful and most sadistic. Of course, life and death are pretty cheap most of the time, and she confronts the woman who killed her daughter and cooks up a fate worse than death. Jaime Lannister has sex with his sister and then leads men into battle against the Tyrells. The queen is left to talk to him and she unashamedly gets in a serious lick and some pretty straightforward advice. I think that there are going to be some really significant confrontations in the next episode. And then there is Bran, who has been ferried around for six seasons, finally meeting up with Sansa, temporary ruler of the North. Excellent episode.",

The dialogues are sharp and witty with great participation of Daenerys, Jon Snow, Tyrion and Cercei. The different tactics adopted by the Machievellian Cercei and Daenerys to win the war are impressive. The subplots are also very interesting. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"The Queen's Justice\"",

Daenerys makes it clear that she is the rightful Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and as such doesn't recognise his kingship of the north... still he must persuade her that it is vital that she helps him in the coming fight against the threat from north of the wall. Back in King's Landing Euron Greyjoy takes his niece, Yara; Ellaria Sand and her daughter Tyene to Cersei so she can have her revenge. Cersei has another visitor; this one from the Iron Bank; she promises that she will repay them soon. At Winterfell Sansa is reunited with Bran. Elsewhere The Unsullied attack Casterly Rock and Jaime's army attacks Olenna Tyrell's home, Highgarden.This was a really fine episode. It provided solid character development, advanced the plot and bid farewell to a favourite character. It was great to see two of the series' protagonists, Daenerys and Jon Snow finally meet; this was handled well with just the right degree of awkwardness; they may both be considered 'good guys' but that doesn't mean they should be friends or even trust each other as each has their own motives. Emilia Clarke and Kit Harington, as Daenerys and Jon, along with Peter Dinklage as Tyrion had impressive scenes together. Lena Headey stood out as we see just how cruel Cersei can be. In other scenes Sophie Turner impressed as Sansa Stark; a character that has improved as the series progressed. Finally Diana Rigg was great as Olenna; her scene with on form Nikolaj Coster-Waldau was top notch. If the episode had any flaws it was the shortness of the battle scenes... although this can be excused as they were meant to be easier than expected for the victors. Overall a really good episode.",

                    "content": "This episode proved to be exactly what I had hoped to get out of an episode that saw Jon Snow and Daenerys meet for the first time. And although that meeting was the core of the episode, it was far from the only important thing that happened tonight. Every scene was beautifully constructed and garnered importance for the long-run. So much so that I know there will be a great deal of scenes I forget to mention in this review. But everyone played their part, and played it well.Beginning in Dragonstone (where we had around 20 minutes of incredible interplay!), Jon & Daenerys didn't get off to the greatest of starts. Even before that, I should mention just how cool it was to see Jon witness 3 dragons fly over his head. 7 seasons guys, and Jon has finally seen a dragon. That and his quippy scenes with Tyrion were a good appetizer to what was to come in Dragonstone. Speaking of Tyrion, I figured he would be the key to this alliance, and his presence was nothing short of vital. Just watching Peter Dinklage listen to the back and forth to Jon & Dany was scene blocking at its best. The blocking in particular between Jon & Dany was impressive as well. It certainly echoes their ancestor's history, as did all of their well-strung dialogue. I honestly couldn't have imagined a better written scene. I understand both sides for sure. Dany has spent the entire length of the show trying to make her way to the iron throne and Jon has spent the better half of the last few seasons battling the dead, there isn't a lot of wiggle room for either side. Which is why I'm glad that the meeting ended up being ambiguous and left open for next week. The aftermath of last week's Greyjoy destruction was certainly felt as Euron walked Ellaria and Yara through the streets of King's Landing like they were his pets. Not sure how Yara's capture will be handled, but it was hard not to see how the Sand family situation was going to go down. Even so, it was devastatingly brutal to watch a mother and daughter not be able to console each other. I've never felt any sort of sympathy towards the Sand's, but Indira Varma's performance was remarkable enough to make me feel something for her.Albeit brief, the time spent in Winterfell was nothing short of awesome. I came around on Sansa a while ago and I really enjoy seeing her in a position of power, especially when she's finally one-upping Littlefinger at his own game. That speech he gave her about \"Everyone is your enemy and everyone is your friend\" summed up his character in one sentence so well. And THEN, Bran showed up, giving us exactly what the episode called for, just a little bit more emotion. I'm not ashamed to say that once again this season got me all teary eyed. These Stark reunions continue to be filled with so much earned emotion, and it looks like we may get another one next week.A few other tidbits (as per usual) that were noteworthy; the Jorah/Sam handshake was great, Melisandre and Varys scene was downright eerie and ominous, Cersei has never been more evil, Daenerys saying \"I'm the last Targaryen\" was pretty on the nose but still clever, Tyrion & Davos always know what to say, the Casterly Rock/Highgarden battle stuff was short but sweet, rest in peace Lady Olenna! We loved having you.+Writing+Legendary meeting+Heartwarming reunion+Major implications in every scene+The pace moves so fast this season10/10",

It would have been even better had they reduced it to a shorter 45 minutes and made another episode which features more great minor characters or other parts of Westeros so we had 8 in the series. The best part was the start with the encounter we had all waited years for, when Ice met Fire. While it didn't happen in the way we thought it would it was still good nevertheless. Meanwhile Cersei is chopping away at Daenery's allies making us wonder whether being Queen of the Ashes is better than being Queen of nothing in the seven kingdoms. The other events and parts of the episode seemed to drag on with some things happening but not a lot in the whole hour. Having said all that it was still a quality episode. Lets be honest this is easily one of the greatest shows of all time and we are probably in for some big events and episodes. So I will eagerly await the coming episodes",

The pacing is great and doesn't drag even if it's around an hour and the directing/editing continues to be solid. The performances continue to be terrific as well with Kit Harrington and Emilia Clarke during the interaction of Jon Snow and Queen Daenerys along with the final performances of Diana Rigg, Rosabell Laurenti Sellers and Indira Varma as Olenna Tyrell, Tyene Sand, and Ellaria Sand. Especially when Olenna confessed that she was the one who killed Joffrey after she drinks poisoned wine and the two ladies of the Sand who got captured by Euron Greyjoy and given to Cersei Lannister as gifts to their marriage once their war is won. Ramin Djawadi continues to deliver in his beautiful score and fitted really well. And finally, the bait-and-switch scene concerning Casterly Rock and Highgarden which is also well-written. Overall this is another great episode and the seventh season continues to be even more compelling.",

                    "content": "After what I think has been a slow but intense start to the season, this was the episode I was really looking forward to. As I've said in previous weeks, the show is starting to bring people together from across the map and for me that is the exciting part. Once they are together than I believe that they can really start to crank it up towards the end as we will have a few major parties all fighting for the throne instead of multiple spread across the map.This episode in many was did what I wanted it to. There were 2 major connections/reconnections that happened this episode which I think is going to change the course of the show. The first is of course Jon and Daenerys meeting for the first time. For many these have been the power pair of the show, and after what we discovered last season, the power family. I really liked the dynamic between the 2 leaders, considering that they both had completely different agendas for the meeting. We will have to wait to see how they pair out as a partnership or as enemies, but I'm sure the truth of their family will come out and change their dynamic.Which brings me to the other reconnection this episode, Bran and Sansa. Bran has always had a similar story arc to Ayra for me where their own stories are interesting enough but you struggle to see where this will fit in the greater of the show. Now that Bran has returned to Winterfell though, everything has changed. With the knowledge he has now going to be with Sansa and in turn Jon, this reconnection is the one that can throw the biggest spanner into the works.Stepping away from the connections, we also had a lot happen around the Lannisters. With that we saw the end of 2 other forces in the fight for the throne. We saw Olenna Tyrell gracefully accept defeat with a quiet drink, which I thought was a terrifically written and performed scene, as well as the Sand Snakes getting stung by their own medicine in which I thought was a really good poetic way for Cersei to take them out.Overall, this was a really solid episode which I think is finally putting some serious motion into the wheels of this season. It's hard to think we are at the half way point next week, but after what they have done the previous 3 episodes, especially this one, I think we are in for a very interesting second half to the season.9/10",

                    "content": "I have to say, the show fails at different aspects than the ones I fear ahead of watching it; for example, the Jon - Daenerys meeting is actually not cringe-worthy. In fact, if anything, it seems more like an wasted opportunity: Daenerys' portrayal may remain annoyingly wise and saintly, but I will say Kit Harrington does a great job of playing \"tired of this sh*t\". The scene where he warns about the danger in the North is actually quite good - but it could be a lot better. Something is missing, whether it is that the dialogue doesn't contain anything really memorable, or that it somehow feels wrong to focus the danger on the walking dead (the White Walkers seem to me a far scarier enemy but are referenced only in relation to the Night's King, I don't know, it felt a little iffy).That said, one can't help but laugh at how Jon arrives by sea to Dragonstone in about what, a day, since the terrible winds of winter only blow against Stannis and the seas are calm and the skies are clear even in Winterfell.Speaking of Winterfell, Bran Stark comes back and maybe I am prejudiced, but in his dialogue with Sansa at the Godswood he was like some combination of an emo kid (\"you can't understand me, sis, no one can, leave me be *ANGST*. It' so hard to explain that someone else was the three-eyed crow before, but now it's me\") and an after- hours radio producer (\"and this next....song is for...mmmh, Sansa...who looked so...so pretty in her wedding dress\")In King's Landing, we get a second failed mirror scene. Much like the deplorable reflection of the red wedding from Arya, we get a reflected walk of shame, with Ellaria and Tyene Sand (apparently) taking the role of Cersei - except of course it's cheaper, with the crowd at varying times either angrily throwing vegetables or merrily chanting \"murderess\" while smiling (wat). Then we proceed to Cersei getting her revenge on the Dornish women, which gives Lena Headey a chance to act, but....well, it's supposed to be a dramatic scene, with Ellaria being forced to witness the slow death of her daughter. But no one cares, since Tyene (apparently) Sand, like her sisters, was just an annoying, insultingly written stock character that we couldn't stand. So, yeah, sorry D&D, but your supposed drama is betrayed by your previous heinous crimes.But let's get to the bulk of the episode. In the previous episode, Daenerys lost all her fleet 'except for 2-3 ships'. Now, she has sent another fleet (maybe I missed something, I don't know, but just how many ships did she have, I seem to remember 10 people stealing 100 from Pyke and that's all) to take Casterly Rock - they succeed because of...secret tunnels...(such an exquisitely fresh idea), but it was a trap, as suddenly, Euron's teleporting starfleet appears. Burned the fleet yesterday evening, brought the prisoners to the queen in the morning, burned another fleet by noon - OK, maybe he wasn't actually there for the second battle, but com' on, all these people do journeys that should take months in a couple of hours, have some pity, TV time and all. Not to mention nobody appears capable of noticing a fleet in this show. Invisible fleet at Meereen, check. Invisible fleet attacks Yara, check. Invisible fleet follows the Unsullied, check.Admittedly, ignoring the laughable teleportations, the scheme to abandon Casterly Rock to get Highgarden was clever. Except for the fact that Highgarden is completely undefended, Olenna Tyrell arrived there how the hell exactly (she was in Dragonstone, who took her there? When? How? Did the Unsullied fleet drop her off? Just how quick is it?), Jaime leads another invisible army that the Tyrells simply couldn't possibly notice, and even if you are one of the fans who takes leaps of faith over all these bottomless plot holes, we get zero battles. I repeat, the Lannister stratagem, despite its senseless timeline and its phantom armies, was sort of clever. And instead of creating some suspense out of it, with the Unsullied winning Casterly Rock after a difficult battle only to reveal it was a trap, we get both sieges in ten seconds. Budget reasons, I know, but maybe cut pointless dragon footage?Olenna is given a half-decent farewell, but those of us who have been paying attention can't help but feel sorry for Jaime Lannister. A character who was portrayed from villain to antihero, with his account on why he killed the Mad King being one of the most poignant scenes in the entire series, only for his character development to be reverse engineered back to episode 1 and the things he does for love. After all the previous evolution, nothing he does makes sense. His whole relationship with Brienne, his losing his hand causing Cersei's resentment, his respect for the enemy, it all served a single character goal. To show that he drifts away from his sister. But Benioff and Weiss cancel every single of those plot lines. Why? My guess is so that they show his eventual betrayal as a shocking twist, to the facepalm of millions. Such a shame for Jaime Lannister.As an afterthought, Jorah is completely cured in HALF A DAY. The Archmaester tries to convince a disbelieving audience that yes, this was an extremely dangerous procedure that revered maesters couldn't do properly, but well done, guy who cleans sh*t, you did it.Well acted, well produced, horridly written by two people who should have given creative control and script writing to literally anyone else the moment they ran out of book material, because they utterly suck at it.PS: Olenna and Jaime explaining to the audience the devious Lannister plan we watched in the previous two scenes was really sad and should tell you all you need to know of D&D's target audience.",

She caused much of the trouble including their father's death by her false accusation.Meantime Daenerys is losing because she tried to me merciful. And has sat in Dragonstone with her dragons, rather than going either to ferry the fleet from Dorn or help the Unsullied. Really no logic to it.On the positive side, she ends up being sensible about Jon Snow refusing to accept her as Queen of the North.We also get a repeat of the hint that the Red Priestesses know something Varys, who may have more secrets than he has revealed. One of them told him she knew what the demon said when he was a child. Now Melisandre tells him that both she and he are doomed to die in Westeros.

Seeing Jon and Dany meet for the first time was as good as it could have been, you can see both their points. Dany wants to be a strong wise leader, and Jon wants to save his people from the oncoming threat. The dialogue between both characters was very well written, and felt like something George R. R Matrin had written himself.When Euron paraded the Sand Snakes through King's Landing, and presented them to Cersei, I couldn't help but feel happy for her, these people killed her daughter. This is what this show and episode does so well, we know Cersei is the bad guy, we know she's cruel and sadistic, but yet we also root for her. The Sand Snakes have never really been that important, so their demise is not really gut wrenching, but that scene between mother and daughter was really well done, and the acting from Indira Varma was flawless.We also get another reunion between two Starks. Seeing Bran arrive back at Winterfell was emotional, and seeing the look of Sansa's face was perfect. Sophie Turner has really upped her game this time around, and has been delivering some of her best ever acting. I also like that Sansa isn't being turned into another Cersei, she is actually appearing to be very good at ruling, thinking of her people before anything else, all the while listening to the scheming whispers of Littlefinger.The biggest part about this episode is its battle scenes. While unlike the previous battles we have seen, these ones feel poetic. And for the first time, Tyrion isn't the smartest guy in the room, he gets outplayed by Jamie, which is some very smart writing on the creators part. The siege of Casterly Rock was stunning, it was perfectly paced and served its purpose well. When we finally get a look at Highgarden, the absolutely stunning visuals in this scene has to be some of the best I've ever seen in TV. that glorious sunset that beamed across the arriving Lannister army was like something out of a painting.The final scene in this episode, played out brilliantly. With Lady Olenna Tyrell, despite her defeat, has managed to place one last wound in the Lannisters, by revealing that she in fact killed Joffery. This scene was so powerful and long coming, and the end of her character is something I am surely going to miss. The Queen's Justice is one of the best Game of Thrones episodes, because it not only felt like an episode from the earlier seasons, but blended in beautiful story telling with great visuals and powerful emotions.10/10",

                    "content": "The season just got interesting! Who would have expected things would turn out this way. When Daenerys set out for Westeros at the end of season 6 with allies from Dorne, Iron Islands and Highgarden, who would have thought she would lose them all within two episodes and everything will go into dumpster fire. Daenerys seemed to be the clear winner, with the rest of the bystander kingdoms despising Cersei. Three episodes down and the game has completely changed. Cersei has won the battle so far, defeating and forming ally with Iron Island and Reach. Dorne hangs away.Cersei always enjoys sudden moments of highs. She had an absolute low for the nine episodes of season 6 and then she rocketed her way to glory in the finale. Here again she jumps to top. It's interesting how Tyrion's plans failed even though all we've gotten this season was just throwback and repetition of the master plans that we had seen before. That is disappointing because it shows that Tyrion, as smart as he may be, still isn't smarter than Cersei, regardless of what he had said about her smartness in season 2.Even though Jon-Dany's union was supposed to be the most sought after one, the episode is so delightfully packed with action that it just seems another big piece in the pudding. The meeting of Jon and Daenerys was, thankfully, realistically portrayed instead of doing fan service and quickly throwing them into each other's arms. The song of ice and fire will take some time to start playing. The arguments from both the sides were fun to watch while Tyrion tried to play the role of the mediator. Cersei's revenges are always worth watching, irrespective of whom you are rooting for. The way she gets back at Ellaria (who by the way acted amazingly well this episode), is another great throwback to season 5. Even though she might most certainly still not win the war against Daenerys, it seems interesting what she is planning to do with Euron if the battle is indeed won. He is not going to be fooled to death that easily.It was funny to see how there were in total two battles in this episode and yet they finished both off within 10 minutes. The budget constraint could be one reason. Another being the importance these battles hold in the narrative. As interesting as these battle sequences could have been, their ending was predictable. It's good to see them focusing more on the storyline. Small mistakes aside, one complain that I am having with this season is the pace of the show. It is going too fast now. This leads to thinning down of the plot. Every battle is happening everywhere. It would be better to show them in a complex way rather than continuing to haste it to the end, keeping the audience in the pretence of the same old GoT feels.Special mention - Sansa-Bran reunion. The stark theme always gets you.Foreseeing- Sansa-Bran-Arya reunion is imminent. Probably the next episode will feature that. Jon-Dany bond will strengthen as Dany chooses to fight the battle in the north before heading towards Cersei. Overall, a brilliant episode which concluded a lot of story lines while building up towards finale simultaneously.8.8/10",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Despite liking \"Dragonstone\" and \"Stormborn\" (though both had issues) and loving \"The Queen's Justice\", \"The Spoils of War\" is superior to all three and the first more-than-great episodes of Season 7 at its half-way point. It not only is a contender for the best of the seventh season, it's also one of the best ever 'Game of Thrones' episode to me and many other fans. Bran is not as well written as the rest of the characters but with everything done so phenomenally this was insignificant.\"The Spoils of War\" does much more than set up and putting things into place. Things are even more eventful than in \"The Queen's Justice\", more intricate, have more tension in the character relationships, characters and storylines show better progression, there's very little if at all padding and nothing really jars.Love the character interactions and the way the characters are written. The standout interactions, whether it was the romantic tensions and the fiery intensity, were between Arya and Sansa, Arya and Brienne and particularly Jon and Daenerys. The highlight of the episode, and perhaps the single greatest scene of Season 7 and one of the greatest scenes/battles in 'Game of Thrones' history, is the climactic Dothraki battle. Gorgeously filmed, thrillingly choreographed and blistering in emotion and tension, the multiple points of view fascinating.All of the acting is on point with no exceptions. Maisie Williams, Emilia Clarke and Kit Harrington are on top form, and Peter Dinklage can do no wrong.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Writing is some of the layered, nuanced, sensitive, thought-provoking and passionate of the whole show. The pacing is never rushed or draggy, remarkable for a lot going on and so many characters, yet it never feels over-stuffed or under-developed. Overall, magnificent. 10/10 Bethany Cox",

The first half is full of the usual interesting conversations and character work, work that this time is moving the story forwards into better places. But it's the climax, the wagon train set-piece, that really sets this apart from the crowd, featuring a bravura sequence involving Daenerys and her dragons which sees them truly letting rip for the first time. The destruction is marvellous, the CGI faultless, and the only slight disappointment that ridiculous underwater shot in which Jaime appears to have fallen into the Mariana Trench.",

Arya arrives at Winterfell and is finally reunited with Sansa and Brandon. At Dragonstone John finds the dragon glass and once again asks Daenerys to help in the upcoming battle in the north; he also advises her not to attack the Red Keep... that doesn't mean she isn't going to attack the Lannister forces elsewhere.I've enjoyed season seven so far but this episode manages to take things to another level. It started well with the first half being dominated by the reunion of Arya and Sansa. These scenes were suitably handled; at first the guards try to deny Arya access to Winterfell; then when she tells Sansa about her list of people she intends to kill her sister is mildly amused... until she sees what an accomplished fighter Arya has become when she spars with Brienne. Maisie Williams, Sophie Turner and Gwendoline Christie are great in these scenes. As good as that was there was better to come as Jaime and the Lannister army are attacked by the Dothraki horde and Daenerys, who is riding a dragon. This was one of the best battle sequences to date; it started gradually as first a gentle rumble was heard; it quickly built to a crescendo as battle commences and Daenerys's dragon burnt dozens of opposing soldiers when close combat lead to the sort of mayhem one would expect... it had the intensity one would expect from a big budget Hollywood movie rather than a mid-season TV episode. I have no idea how the series will follow up this episode but look forward to finding out.",

We knew season 7 was going to have a quicker pace and a clearer purpose, but I didn't expect this much to happen this fast. There have now been quite a few battles this season, and not one of them have seen both sides come prepared. It's going to be interesting to see how things will shake out when both Cersei and Dany have their armies ready. Or maybe because we've gotten so many battles already, the fight for the Throne will be quiet and quick? Unlikely, but I wouldn't put it past Dave and Dan. In all, The Spoils of War was quite the episode.It's weird to think yet another Stark reunion will take second or third fiddle to the rest of the episode's events, but guys Arya finally made it back to Winterfell! I'm starting to think Winterfell will be the home to quite a few main characters once Jon makes it back and The Hound fights off his demons. Who knows, maybe even Melisandre will make her way to Winterfell. She did tell Arya she'll see her again someday. Anyways, I enjoyed the Arya and Sansa reunion, but not for the reasons I suspected. The tension between them shouldn't be unexpected at all, considering they've never been that close, but for some reason I expected something else. However, seeing Arya begin to train with Brienne was a sight to see. Some really well choreographed sword fighting and camera tricks fooled me, because it sure looked like Maisie Williams was doing all her own stunts. Bran continues to be a frustrating character. I feel like there could have been a way to portray his transformation into the Three-eyed- Raven a little bit more poignant. Instead, he feels like a monotone creep. Perhaps when he gets that Targaryen secret off his chest he'll cool down. But hey, Littlefinger's Valyrian Steel dagger was passed onto Bran and then to Arya, so I guess his presence was worth it, right?At the beginning of the episode I wrote down in my notes \"when will the tables turn back to Daenerys' side?\", well I think I got my answer. After Dany received more cautionary advice from Jon, she decided to take back control of the war by wiping out most of the Lannister army with Drogon and the Dothraki. It's hard to beat the pulse-pounding and emotional 'Battle of the Bastards' last year, but they sure did their best to outdo themselves once again. Everything from the screams of the Dothraki army to the breathtaking cinematography of Dany riding Drogon into battle. Pitting her against Jaime and Bronn made it increasingly difficult who to root for. Perhaps the only downside was that nobody significant died. There was a part of me that thought Bronn may meet his end, or even Drogon/Jaime. Heck, they were teasing a queen-slayer moment for Jaime. Does that give us any hint that Cersei may meet her end that way? Regardless, the tension was masterfully directed. One of the best battles this show has ever given us.The other main talking point will probably be the increasing romantic tension between Dany and Jon. It may be awkward and weird, but it's not like either of them know Jon's true parentage, so for now it's harmless. For those who doubt the show will ever go that route, I don't think they would have Daavos ask Jon what he thought about her & include Dan and Dave discussing both of their attractions toward each other in the \"inside the episode\" segment. Whether you like it or not, the show is going that route. Oh and by the way, Dany casually mentions that she will fight for Jon in the war for the dawn. Hell yeah.+Queen-slayer+Romantic tension+THAT battle+Cinematography & choreography+Another Stark reunion10/10",

This show beautifully and perfectly captures battle scenes and the camera-work is really well done. We saw a showdown and collision of worlds we have waited long to see. The battle scene between Daenery's and the Dothraki vs the Lannister forces is arguably one of the best moments in this series. Seeing a dragon wipe out Lannister forces in Westoros was truly satisfying. Like many fans I watched the final moments in awe as I shuddered at who would die. This show has bluntly wiped out big characters in an instant. When we saw Jaimie go for Daenerys it looked like a major character would die but the show beautifully gave us a stalemate with both surviving. This episode got everything right from a great opening, dialogues, reunions at Winterfell to an epic battle. Jaimie's expression as he sunk into the Ocean was the same expression I had as I tried to fathom what just happened in the last 10 minutes.Thank you is what I want to say for a breathtaking episode. I can only wait in great anticipation for the next episode.",

Tyrion didn't want Jaime to run charging at Daenerys like a 'fucking idiot', and even though they're brothers on opposite sides of a war, you don't want to see either of them come to harm. They're simply in a fight they want to see come to a not-so-bitter end.Spoils of War is another great and massively important chapter in Game of Thrones.",

The performances continue to be strong, the characters still remain compelling, the pacing never drags, the directing/editing are still solid. The writing also continues to be superb including scenes where Jon Snow and Daenerys interacted at Dragonstone and where Arya and Brienne of Tarth interact with each other for the first time they meet before they dueled each other which is also satisfying. Overall, The Spoils of War exceeded my expectations and is another solid episode in the seventh season. Recommended :)",

Great work by the director and great writing by the writers. I really don't hesitate to give this episode ten out of ten stars.",

But it compensates with the very good story and some of the best sequences ever in GoT. And since this episode leaked on the Web, I'll try as much as I can to make this review as spoiler-free as possible.This is one of those episodes that just gets better as the episode progresses. At the beginning there are scenes that in a way just makes this episode pick up where the previous left off with Jamie talking to Bronn about his reward and Bran back at Winterfell giving Littlefinger and old reference he once told Varys some seasons ago. This episode just shows how much Bran has changed since he's now \"The three Eyed raven\" pointed out by a dialogue scene with Meera.Then as the episode progressed nothing much happened at Winterfell until Arya's arrival which gets the plot going from there. There are some good moments especially between her and Brienne which showcases how much she's come along as a fighter and also as an assassin.From there the episode goes to the most interesting place in this episode, Dragonstone. And the plot there unlike last episode moves on very well making slowly out of Daenerys a believer in the Walkers. There is a scene you might see it coming, I was expecting it, that reveals things from the past battles of men and children against white walkers. And then there is a scene that just develops the relationship between Jon and Danny even more to the point where you think Danny agrees easily to help Jon. But things aren't so simple with the stubborn \"Mother of Dragons\".There are also some dialogues between Daavos and Jon that showcases what Jon feels for Daenerys. And there's another scene that explores what Tyrion told Jon last episode about asking other people what they think of the \"Mad King\"'s daughter. There's another tense moment between Daenerys and her advisers which is settled by Jon with a very mature speech to her, making Danny realize for herself what her next move in this war should be. Then there's a scene by the shores of Dragonstone which by what the photos released by HBO this week have shown involves another reunion that's not as good as the Stark reunion at Winterfell.And then of course is the last 10 minutes which I won't spoil, because there some of the very best moments ever shown in GoT, a moment you might have expected and also a face-off that most of us longed to see it. The episode ends with a classic cliffhanger finish for the episode that will leave you wanting the next episode so bad.To wrap up, I'll summarize all into this: This episode proves again that this season is one of the best seasons ever in GoT with great storytelling and breathtaking action that in my opinion comes close(speaking of this episode) to the Battle of Bastards.10/10",

                    "content": "This was the episodes I have been waiting for. For 3 weeks we have been building and building to the point where we were about to explode. And then it did this week.Before getting into the episode itself, I need to make mention of something I really noticed has been different this season. While I have previously addressed the cause of it, I feel as though each episode this season has had less \"stand-out\" moments, however those moments are bigger, and I think that is all because there are less story lines happening. More paths are being crossed and twinned together, and with that, one character having a big moment usually means that many of our main characters are also having that big moment. With that being said, it's time to dive into this week's episode.There were two \"stand-out\" moments for me this episode, and I think that many others will have the same. The first is something that has been a long time coming and that is Ayra returning to Winterfell. Last week we saw Bran return, so now all the living siblings have finally reconnected. This was a moment I didn't think we would ever get to in the show. While Jon wasn't present, just knowing that all the Starks are occupying the same location nearly 6 seasons since they last were is an amazement. In a show like this, you don't expect stuff like this to happen because of the rate characters die off.\u00a0The return of all the Starks has started a really interesting dynamic between them that I am really liking. We know Bran is a lot different from the little boy he left as. Sansa is now as strong leader amongst the people. And Ayra is a badass fighter who can take on Brienne. I like how all those changes are having different effects on the other siblings, especially Sansa seeing Ayra fight.\u00a0The second stand-out moment was of course the stand-out of the episode, the Dothraki and a dragon against Jaime's army. We all knew this wasn't going to end well for Jaime's army but I didn't think it would end in that much destruction. While we have seen the dragons in action previously, we have never seen anything to the calibre of this. We knew Daenerys was a force but now everyone else does. Most importantly though, this is the conflict moment I have been waiting for for seasons now. The first battle between the Lannisters and the Targaryens. This changes the show going forward. For now this is a Lannister vs Targaryen war and everyone else better pick a side. Except for the White Walkers.Quickly touching on the other aspects of the episode, while the action in the battle was amazing and will be the thing that is remembered from this episode, there were also some really well written, shot and performed moments during this episode. The main few that come to mind is between Jon and Daenerys in the cave, Arya and Sansa when they first reconnect at Winterfell and Bran and Littlefinger talking about the dagger. While Game of Thrones personally sits a outside of what I would consider my favourite shows, there is no denying that this is one of the best shows ever created and episodes like this show it.10/10",

                    "content": "I will say this. This was the first episode in the past 3 seasons that managed to excite me, apart from \"the door\".But, despite a (very) good battle sequence, it overall suffered from the same ails as its predecessors.At Winterfell, Bran continues being very emo, and I still can't say if it's the acting or the writing that makes him rather silly. On a sidenote, it's uncertain if the show has understood, or decided, what the three-eyed crow is. Of course, the main theme is Arya's return - and as she arrives at Winterfell, we are once again reminded how the Winter has come, but only when needed, as the skies are bright and the weather seems better than when Robert came. It's a detail, I know, but persistently annoying. After a needless \"comic\" scene with two guards, Arya meets with Sansa and it's...well, OK, if a bit underwhelming I guess. Arya's sparring with Brienne may cause you to remember that Arya had never actually shown any great skill with the sword before, but heck, let's let that slide.Meanwhile, on Dragonstone, Jon easily convinces Daenerys of the White Walker threat, by showing her impressively convenient cave drawings in the dragonglass mines. It might be smart to reveal he drew them himself, but I won't hold my breath.But let's get to the battle. As I said, the battle itself is very good, perhaps great. It's buildup is not, since, for the umpteenth time in a row, a huge army appears without anyone noticing. Daenerys has lost all her ships, TWICE, but still has enough to carry all the Dothraki across the sea to the mainland. She does that unseen, because Euron's teleporting fleet is conveniently unpowered at the moment, and because there is no one watching the sea between King's Landing and Dragonstone in case someone tries to cross. Even worse, a khalasar of Dothraki cross the continent (the Roseroad is not next to the sea) and no one sees them.The Dothraki and a Derperys-ridden dragon turn off the cloaking device and attack the Lannisters, and I suppose my angry shouting at \"derp derp dracarys derp derp\" was a sign I was enjoying the scene. Not enough to not wonder why they waited so long before remembering \"oh, we have this anti-dragon crossbow\", not enough to miss how easy it was to predict \"missed first shot, second one hits the dragon on the wing\", but still, it was good fun. And now for the narrow miss. I have been unspeakably disappointed with GoT for two and a half years now. But yesterday, for a brief moment, I was ready to forgive all the crimes, all the transgressions, all the plot holes and the character de-evolution, even the sand snake dialogues. I knew it wouldn't happen. I was certain it wouldn't, after all the episode had been leaked and this kind of spoiler wouldn't be contained. But as Jaime charged towards the disgusting, hated, despised, vile and unworthy mother of madness, I allowed myself to hope he would cut her in half, and leave legions of whining fans with their mouths gaping in disbelief. This, D&D, would be a twist, not your predictable and plot-cancelling nonsense. A great, plausible, unforeseen turn of the tide. I allowed myself to hope and be disappointed. But I suppose even having this moment is something.",

The dagger used to try to kill Bran and then to frame Tyrion reappears, indicating it is going to have some further role. Littlefinger gives it to Bran, evidently thinking he can fool him. We later learn that Sansa no longer trusts Littlefinger at all, warning Bran that the man is entirely selfish. We see a deepening relationship between Jon and Daenerys. And he shows her evidence of the White Walkers as an ancient menace. A force that early on became hostile to the Children of the Forrest, even though they created them. Arya returns and renews her friendships, though disconcerted to find Bran so changed. He gives her the special dagger, again indicating it will be used for something. With it, she might even kill the Night King.She also tests herself against Brienne. She seems to have a slight advantage, but not decisive as she would have with most people.Daenerys at last uses one of her three dragons \u2013 maybe the other two were omitted to keep down costs of CGI, just as Jon's wolf was omitted at the Battle of the Bastards. With the dragon she uses her Dothraki to attack the Lannister army, deprive Kings Landing of supplies and also show the city what she can do. She seems to have just missed the gold, which would have been a much bigger prize since the Iron Bank does not view the Lannister debts as settled until it arrives.Bronn wounds Drogon in a scene reminiscent of Bard killing Smaug, but the immediate effect is just to force the dragon to land. It's not clear how badly Drogon is hurt: will he die or recover?",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.After such a magnificent previous episode in \"The Spoils of War\", it is understandable that fans would want the next episode to be good or as worthy, even if it wasn't as good or a masterpiece (both of which a tall order seeing as such high quality is difficult to equal or surpass). Unfortunately, \"Eastwatch\" turned out to be a major disappointment. Not just the worst episode of the seventh season, but also for me the worst episode since Season 6's \"No One\" and one of my least favourite 'Game of Thrones' episodes. It's not terrible, it's actually watchable but for a show as great as 'Game of Thrones' watchable is not good enough.\"Eastwatch\" certainly has good things. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects are among the best of the latter season episodes.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The acting is, considering the material, quite good, though no tour-De-force performances. Lena Headey and Peter Dinklage come off best, concerning Dinklage though it is very difficult to get a bad performance from him. A reasonable job is done setting things up and putting things into place. There are minor revelations, such as Gendry's return, and some nice reunions. As well as some good attention to character interaction, such as Arya and Sansa, with Cersei being the most interesting character here.However, there are disappointing elements which generally have been covered already. There are no real surprises or shocks, the biggest revelations are not huge and not leaving-one-floored-like. Other episodes do a much better job advancing characters and progressing the story in general. There are moments here but not enough. It all feels rather bland, lacking the fire-blazing intensity of \"The Spoils of War\". \"Eastwatch\" is far too rushed, making events feel choppy and jumpy. Too much of the story is not developed e nough and borders on the implausible. Tyrion's plan agreed especially, easily the most absurd and lacking-in-consistency-and-logic story he's had and such an interesting character is much better than this. For a show whose scripts are generally thought-provoking, layered, passionate and sensitive, the writing here majorly disappoints and actually the complete opposite. Here the writing is forced, repetitive, bland, simplistic and far from subtle. The character writing has been far meatier, nuanced and complex.Overall, watchable but hugely disappointing. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

All of the dialogue and scenes zing, particularly those with Daenerys and the surrendered soldiers, which offer a neat portent of things to come for those who remain in denial about events late on in the show. Plus there's an excellent return for fan favourite Gendry, whose scenes are warm and surprisingly funny, and a fine DIRTY DOZEN style setup that gives us a welcome taste of what's to come in the next episode.",

When one looks at the simple disrespect for life, it's interesting he wasn't stabbed in his crib. This has led to him being a truly moral character, having had to overcome so much, including the betrayal by his own sister. Tyrion believes in some sort of peaceful settlement. The big war is coming and Cersei hasn't got all that much of an army and must depend on alliances (she has lots of gold). It is decided by Dany and Jon Snow that capturing one of the wights and bringing him to Cersei would seal the deal. Why is this so? So off go our heroes to capture one of these guys, amidst the hordes of the undead (they seem to come back even when you break them into pieces). I fail to see any of the logic in this, other than to set up a battle with these guys. We also have Sansa and Arya at odds. Arya thinks Sansa has taken the easy road, playing up to whomever she can manipulate. Arya, of course, has become the consummate warrior. This is Ana intriguing episode, but it doesn't lack a good deal of common sense and some sort of precious moments.",

Jon and a group head to the Wall and meet prisoners of he Night's Watch that accept to join them in their journey to capture a Wight.\"Eastwatch\" is another excellent episode of \"Game of Thrones\" with great segments. The journey of Jon Snow and his group will certainly be the greatest attraction of the next episode. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"Eastwatch\"",

There Lannister forces are captured and given a choice; bend the knee to Daenerys or die... a threat she follows through on. Once she returns to Dragonstone listens to a plan that might enable a truce; at least until the Wight's are defeated... if they can be defeated. This entails Tyrion having a secret meeting with his brother while Davos Seaworth goes to see an almost forgotten character and bring him back into the action. Back in Winterfell Arya believes Sansa isn't running things as well as she might and suspects Littlefinger of treachery.Not surprisingly this episode isn't quite as impressive as the previous one; it is all about the character development as people come to terms with what happened. People had heard of Daenerys's dragons; now they have to deal with their reality as well as the fighting prowess of the Dothraki. The events in Winterfell were intriguing as loyalties are questions; particularly that of Littlefinger; a character who has always been delightfully devious. While there may be a lot less action that doesn't mean there is none; two men die in the fire of Daenerys's dragon and two more get their heads caved in when they get a little too nosey. There are some faults; over the last few episodes we have seen characters travelling very long distances within the course of the episode; here it happens even more so with no obvious indication that time has passed. Overall I still really enjoyed the episode and look forward to seeing what will happen now key characters are north of the wall again.",

                    "content": "Wow. I'm really trying to appreciate the last episodes we have of this show because I don't believe there will ever be another show like it. For most of its run, Thrones has been a pleasantly slow-paced series. Part of its charm was seeing the show build out character arcs and plots so that when they finally paid off, it would have immense rewards. This season is an entirely different animal. Characters all of a sudden have teleportation abilities going from one side of the map to the other in merely an episode. Some people may be turned off by such a thing, I myself am just enjoying this ride. Things needed to happen faster this season and next, and the pace hasn't slowed down since the season 7 premiere. 'Eastwatch' was perhaps the least eventful episode in terms of action, but it nonetheless was full of goodies from beginning to end.There's so much to dig into, so I'll try to keep everything brief. Let's begin with Jon and Daenerys, because obviously. Let's just establish the fact that this show is ACTUALLY going there with them romantically. Don't tell me nobody else noticed how enamored Dany looked when Jon started talking about how he put his trust in her a few episodes back. I mean, wow, talk about a look. Putting aside the heritage issue, I'm all for this relationship. Which, brings me to Sam because him and Gilly literally came across the biggest bombshell of the show's history, and just swept it under the rug. I guess it's not technically official just yet, but Rhaegar and Lyanna apparently did have a secret marriage that only one maester knows about. So, in other words, Jon is a legitimate Targaryen!Speaking of bastards, Gendry finally made his return to the show tonight as he all of a sudden joined the main story thread. I would say it felt random and out of place, but his weapon is just too damn cool to say anything bad about him. This all lead to Jon, Gendry, Tormund, Jorah (yes, he returned too!), Beric, Thoros, and the flipping Hound heading to Eastwatch to try and capture a white walker to provide Cersei with proof of who the real enemy is. I'm sorry, but we just have to appreciate the Magnificent Seven of Game of Thrones taking on the army of the dead by themselves. We may not have gotten a battle this episode, but ending with them walking out into the abyss was good enough for me.I guess this brings me to Winterfell, where Bran had the vision of the army and Littlefinger plotted a little more. It seems fitting that Arya will eventually kill Littlefinger, but I'm enjoying just watching them two spy-each other-out for now. Having him set her up with the message Sansa wrote to Winterfell back in season 1 is frustrating (because who the heck would care about that at this point?) but it will provide enough weight for the tension between sisters to result in a bada** Littlefinger death scene, I just know it.There were a few Lannister reunions this week. Jaime returned to Cersei with bad news and Tyrion tried to convince Jaime to agree to talk to Cersei about a meeting between Dany and her. I almost highly doubt that meeting will ever get to face-face, wildfire is sure to play some sort of factor, but the direction they're going with this war is intriguing to say the least. To make things even more complicated, Cersei claims she is pregnant with her and Jaime's 4th child. I say claims because this could just be another ploy for her to gain Jaime's trust back, but it could also very well be real. If it is, doesn't it seem fitting that someone kills her through the gut just like the Lannister's did to Robb and Talisa back at the red wedding? Brutal, yes, but this show often provides great payback.Among other things, some great tidbits include: Jon petting Drogon! The combinations of Tyrion & Davos, and Jon & Gendry. Loved seeing a Stark and Baratheon reunion. And I'm glad Sam is finally leaving the Citadel, too bad he never found out about the fate of his father and brother. Overall, not as monumental as I thought it might be, but so dang effective. Game of Thrones has perhaps never been better than it is right now. Everything is hitting on all cylinders.+All these great dynamics+The Magnificent Seven of the North+More surprises+Jon and Dany potential romance+Gendry is back10/10",

Despite its great moments there were also some issues. The biggest being the length and even pace of the episode. We are given 7 episodes this season and I feel many fans expected the events and intensity to be taken up a notch. However this episode and probably the earlier ones were somewhat slow and maybe even not too eventful. Also I think it would be very hard to follow from last week's Spoil of War episode which was what fans have been begging for. Now don't mistake me, this was a great episode with big moments such as Jon Snow petting the Dragon and the Night King scene. I think this episode and perhaps some of the first ones could have been shortened to 50 or so minutes so we could have additional episodes to make it 8 or even 10! I think many fans might feel the same where we could have had more episodes and more enjoyment if episodes were condensed and less scattered and more focused. Take the last episode which is supposedly the shortest and one of the most acclaimed episodes. I feel next week could be a big episode so I will wait in anticipation. 8.5/10",

The pacing did dragged, there are some scenes that are rushed and other scenes that lacked logic. Also the writing wasn't as strong as the previous episodes and the previous seasons as well with dialog that lacks the pathos of the previous seasons. That being said, everything was fine. The acting is still great with everyone still giving superb performances and characters still be interesting the best coming from Tyrion and Cersei. The directing/editing is neat and the music score from Ramon Djawadinis still beautiful. Overall not terrible and quite decent but my least favorite episode of the seventh season sadly.",

Evidence is needed to determine if a monster really exists or to let people know. Finding evidence requires courage in such a horrible place. The story of this courage is narrated in this episode. When one's family has moved far away from one's homeland by mistake, then many years later one has to come back to that place and stand in front of one of the members of the family. That courage is spoken of in this episode. And when it comes to acting, everyone's performance in this episode has been really great from all the other episodes.

Part of my wanted them to keep pushing on towards the end with spectial after spectial, but at the same time, it is those smaller set up moment of Game of Thrones that makes me enjoy this show the most.This episode turned out the be the second option and I'm happy it did because this is my favourite episode of the season so far. This episode was all set up for what is coming but still had some massive moments that stood out.As usual, this episode was so wonderfully written. There were some terrific exchanges of dialog throughout the episode as well as some well laid out story beats. Some personal moments that stood out for me this episode would have to be Little Finger planting the note of Arya and Tyrion having a meeting with Jamie.OWn the first one, while Little Finger is a character many love to hate, there is no doubting that he is playing this game for the throne better than anyone. He is the Palpatine of this universe and he is constantly pulling the strings from behind the curtain. It's not hard to see why he has lasted so long in this world and part of me wants him to last as long as possible.Onto the Tyrion and Jamie and their meeting, I thought this was a big stepping stone towards what might come in the final season and a half. For me I believe the White Walkers are the end goal and they are starting to hint at that more and more. I think if the Lannister army is going to get on board with the fight against the White Walkers, the relationship between Jamie and Tyrion will be key.Overall, while there isn't too much to say about this episode, I loved it. Everything that happened felt like it is setting up for something and there was no fat that had me bored at any point. Look forward, I'm really excited to see what is going to happen with Jon and his small pack heading beyond the wall. I imagine it is not going to end too well for some but end very well for others so we will have to wait and see.10/10",

                    "content": "I actually liked this episode, probably for a bit different reasons than many. Of course, nothing makes much sense anymore, but that's been going on for a while now.After being thrown into an abyss three centimetres away from where his horse was galloping, Jaime is drawn out of the river by Bronn. The battle is over, and they are really far away from it, leading to all sorts of hilarious conclusions about their ability to travel underwater while in full armor. Just the sort of terrible writing you've come to expect in the show's latest seasons. But then comes the good part, as Hitlaerys Targaryen gathers up the remaining Lannisters and gives them Sophie's choice: Submit to her, Hitler, first of her name, Fuhrer of the Andals, the Rhoynar and the First Men and bend the knee, of be burned alive. Randyll Tarly and his son, whose knees do not bend easily, become the first martyrs in Daenerys' reign of terror. Now now, wait a minute. I think I got carried away a little: Tyrion and Varys are seen worried about the Mad Queen, but we all know D&D do not have the mental capacity to actually make this happen - it's just some temporary sub-plot to later \"relieve\" the audience by reassuring them Daenerys is actually good. Nonetheless: offering a glimpse of Daenerys' true repulsing self is very satisfying, even if her illiterate fans who are actually thrilled at the hint of a romance with Jon (for pity's sake) will still justify it.At Winterfell, Arya offers some terrible advice to the usual bad- advice giver, Sansa, and is then easily tricked by Petyr into discovering something meant to cause strife between the sisters. At least Littlefinger did something remotely devious for the first time in many a season.Back in Oldtown, the ancient clich\u00e9 of \"grey old wise men are wrong and young enthusiastic Sam is right\" continues, as Sam simply ditches them, which is a bit silly, as the entire plot in Oldtown appeared useful in discovering something Stannis had already told him and that idiotic cure of greyscale - they sent him there, but ignoring the whole magic subplot of the books, he had little business to do. Anyway, Sam is a likable character, so not a total waste.On Dragonstone, they decide to send Tyrion to negotiate with Jaime a meeting so that Jon can bring a zombie and convince the Lannisters of the threat in the North. Join is joined in this quest by Mormont, who apparently simply took the first ship to Dragonstone. Naturally, Tyrion, smuggled by Davos, is in sunny King's Landing within the hour, as such a meeting is really easy to arrange. Meeting is over before you know it, Davos retrieves Gendry and they are on their way. Meanwhile Cersei seems to imply that meeting with the enemy is a good chance to dispose of the enemy, but I can already see a Jaime disagreement when he sees evidence of white walkers. The Gendry retrieval is just another case of fan service (complete with meme reference...), which has been the doom of the show and half the reason for its downward spiral in plot quality - however, I will admit I liked how he is modelled after Robert Baratheon, that was a good touch.Jon and his companions leave Dragonstone and are back at Eastwatch- by-the-sea instantaneously, taking the superluminal travels of the show to a whole new level. Indeed, it is buffling that they still send ravens, when everyone can simply walk a letter across at least one continent in half a day. There they find the Hound, Beric and Thoros who strolled across all of Westeros and were captured just around the corner. They pick them up to go to this rather ill-advised quest, which will probably already be over in the next episode, and they may still have time to go to King's Landing for coffee.",

Ned Stark wanted to be noble and Honorable, got captured and killed, Rob betrayed Frey's and we know what happened to him.But now that the show has surpassed the books, the writers are back to writing just typical television where the main characters are invulnerable from their stupid choices. Jaime rides against a dragon, and miraculously escapes not just the fire but capture as well. How does he swim underwater for miles while wearing chain mail, armor and his 20 pound hand? how did he not drown? or get caught by the dothraki?

Any betrayal he may do later on has been sensibly foreshadowed.We are fed rival ideas about Daenerys \u2013 torn between her father's madness and decency. We see that Jon can make friends with a dragon, the first after Tyrion to get close and live. But she can also be alarmingly ruthless.Plot hole \u2013 the monarch can order someone to 'take the black' or die, but anyone can also do it without the monarch's permission. Why won't Randyll Tarly do this, which would also let his son survive? Sam Tarly never notices evidence that will prove that Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar Targaryen. He is also the last Tarly, though still vowed to the Night Watch and does not know it yet. He might put forward his supposed son \u2013 whom I suspect is another Targaryen, Maester Aemon Targaryen having been Caster's unnamed father. Regardless, he is 'back in play'.Another plot hole \u2013 Sam should suggest that the Maesters send someone north to investigate the Dead, and interview those who have seen them. But in a US series, one would expect intellectual to be treated as learned fools.Then the big surprise \u2013 the two Queens may actually make peace to deal with the Army of the Dead. Most of us expected the final battle against them to happen in Season 8, after Daenerys destroyed Cersei. But it's hard to believe that even George R. R. Martin would let the dead be the victors, so this as the final battle would have lacked tension. Instead we may see the Night King fall, possibly with one White Walker surviving to rebuild for another try in some future winter. Meantime the Iron Throne may remain an issue for the final season. Cersei as victor is not impossible, and Gendry is back in play.Meantime Arya mistrusts Sansa and spies on Littlefinger. But Littlefinger somehow knows about her. May be playing a deeper game than we've been led to believe, possibly an ally of the Night King. Regardless, we are probably building up to a grand confrontation among the surviving Starks.",

Eastwatch allows us to breathe after the epic episode last week, and does so in a very character driven way.We open with a brilliant scene between Bronn and Jamie, then are taken to another visually breathtaking scene of Tyrion walking through the ashes of burnt Lannister bodies. Peter Dinklage is truly a master actor, he didn't even have to say a word in this short scene, because his face says it all. He's torn, you know he wants to stand by Dany, but also doesn't want to see his family ruined. The meeting between Jamie and Tyrion was very brief, I would loved to have seen a little more of that, hell even a good scene between Tyrion and Bronn. I sorely missed their on screen duo. The scenes in the North were great also, I loved that not everyone is getting along, as it should be. Arya is calling Sansa on her bulls***, and conducting her own little investigation on Littlefinger. I also loved seeing Baelish doing his sneaking things again.Sam's scenes were more or less the same, but this time he's gotten sick of being told what to do and takes a stand, which I really liked, it shows how much his character has come from the punching bag from season 1. And am I the only one that caught that sneaky line with Gilly reading the marriage certificate? We know what your doing D&D you smart bastards.We get a brilliant meeting between all our favourite characters towards the end of this episode, and I can't wait to see them in action. You know that some of them are going to die, and please I hope the Hound, Jon and Jorah survive. I won't be Game of Thrones without them.Eastwatch is a very character episode, with great production designs, as always, great acting, and a fantastic build-up, to a next episode that is most likely going to be freaking mind-blowing.I can see some people having an issue with this episode, and that would be all the time jumps. Throughout this whole series, things have moved reasonably slow. Characters would take seasons to get from one place to the other, but in this episode, they transport here and there within just a view scenes. But all this is understandable. Things are ending now, the Game is nearly over, and things are moving fast. 9.6/10",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Was admittedly expecting a big improvement over the disappointing \"Eastwatch\" Unfortunately, \"Beyond the Wall\" is even more of a major disappointment. After much debate (after re-watching), have decided that it replaces \"Eastwatch\" as the worst episode of the seventh season, and for me it's one of my least favourite episodes of 'Game of Thrones' episodes along with \"Eastwatch\" and Season 6's \"No One\". It's not an abomination, but for such a great show like 'Game of Thrones' a barely average episode feels nowhere near good enough.Of course \"Beyond the Wall\" certainly has good things. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects are among the best of the latter season episodes.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The acting is, considering the material, quite good, though no tour-De-force performances. Like with all episodes, there are good scenes in \"Beyond the Wall\". The best being the battle between the White Rangers and the dragons, with thrilling epic spectacle and particularly incredible special effects. There is some good character interaction, with the standout (one of the best things of the episode and one of the most interesting and entertaining elements of it) being the northern raiding party interactions. Jon swearing fealty to Daenerys was the one emotional moment. However, there are disappointing elements which generally have been covered already. There are no real surprises or shocks, the only shock being one of the show's biggest character losses. Other episodes do a much better job advancing characters and progressing the story in general. There is nowhere near enough of that here, other episodes even do far better setting things up and putting things into place with one here being too distracted by the writing issues than notice whether the episode did this aspect at all let alone do it well. \"Beyond the Wall\" is far too rushed, making events feel choppy and jumpy. Too much of the story is not developed enough, with ridiculous implausibility and logic-defying present to maximum effect (and this is excluding everything to do with the much criticised time line) that affects the coherence and ability to take it seriously. It is very bland too, very little intensity outside of the aforementioned scenes and the same with the emotional level (which is very low too). Stakes seem to be incredibly low here, due to an uncharacteristic over-obviousness, almost everything being predictable, and things happening and resolving far too easily.For a show whose scripts are generally thought-provoking, layered, passionate and sensitive, the writing here majorly disappoints once again and actually the complete opposite. Here, like in \"Eastwatch\", the writing is forced, repetitive, bland, simplistic and far from subtle. The character writing has been far meatier, nuanced and complex, here apart from Tormund and Daenerys the characters are either out of character (Jon for example) or have lost what made them so great (especially Tyrion).Overall, watchable but underwhelmingly average. 5/10 Bethany Cox",

Getting all of the likeable hero characters together in a group for an epic quest is a very smart move, but I do wish there had been more wit in terms of the dialogue, which too often resorts to playground humour of the sort that's been overwhelming this show for the last two seasons. When you have actors of this charisma and calibre, you want more. Still, the visuals are wonderful and the special effects superb, and there's genuine menace, eeriness and tension throughout in the White Walker scenes. I do find the Arya/Sansa scenes ridiculous in their conception and Maisie Williams laughable when she tries to do menacing. Still, the climax of this episode is a shock I found even more upsetting than the Red Wedding, and that counts for a lot.",

First of all, having to bring one (count it, one) of the walkers back seems like a silly strategy. Did anyone realize they are an endless hoard? That little circle of guys going into the den of the dead is absurd. Their survival for as long as they could was itself pushing the limits. How they saw themselves coming out of this alive is preposterous. Dany is possessed and she pays a price for it. We know Cersei. How is this whole thing going to change anything. Kim Jong Un is a minor leaguer compared to her. Anyway, there's a long battle sequence and I guess some really go for that So be it I'll be interested to see what the narrative hook will be as we end the next to last season.",

Out of the blue, Daenerys come with her dragons to help Jon Snow and the hunting party. Will they succeed in escaping?\"Beyond the Wall\" is another spectacular episode of \"Game of Thrones\". The segment of Arya and Sansa is promising, but the hunting of a Wight by Jon Snow and his team is magnificent. The attack of Daenerys and her \"sons\" is also great and the final plot point is totally unexpected. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"Beyond the Wall\"",

Back at Winterfell Arya confronts Sansa about the message she found in Littlefinger's room; then Sansa makes a disturbing discovery in Arya's room. Meanwhile at Dragonstone Tyrion counsels Daenerys.I really enjoyed this episode; while we didn't get the best battle of the series it was still pretty good even if we have to suspend disbelief as the main characters survive virtually unscathed when outnumbered hundreds to one. That doesn't mean there were no losses; in fact one will almost certainly become very important when the final battle between the living and the dead eventually takes place. Before we get to the battle scenes these characters have some enjoyable interaction as the chat and goad each other. The events at Winterfell are less dramatic but no less interesting; Littlefinger is clearly scheming to turn the Stark sisters against each other but to what end currently isn't clear. The scenes between Arya and Sansa were a highlight of the episode for me; Maisie Williams and Sophie Turner were both on fine form. As expected the special effects were great and the scenery impressive but strangely the thing that impressed me most was the way it captured the feel of being in a blizzard with its grey/blue tinge; one could almost feel the cold. Overall an impressive episode.",

                    "content": "It's extremely hard for this show to match the anticipation from week to week. Beyond the Wall is one of the most highly anticipated episodes of this show's storied history, so it's not a huge surprise that not everything lived up to expectations quite as much as one would hope. With that said, the Night King has a frickin dragon on his side now, that's just about as monumental of an event as this show could have ever given us thus far, so I won't sweep that under the rug.Beyond the Wall mostly played out how we thought it would, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but a lot of the surprise was gone. The idea of bringing a 'White' back to south of the wall was one of the dumbest ideas I can remember, but I bought into it strictly based on the validity of the actor's performance's. However, they pulled it off. They lost Thoros of Myr in the process, and had Gendry walk all the way, only to have him run back and send a raven to Daenerys. It wasn't an entirely successful trip, considering all that happened but the production was certainly something to behold.How gorgeous were those wide shots of them walking in wastelands filled with ice and snow? Which brings me to the other thing I loved about this episode, those conversations between Tormund & The Hound, or Jon and Beric, or Jorah and Jon. Just so many untapped dynamics at play tonight, and they all played out wonderfully. That is, up until the point in which an undead bear attacked the group, nearly taking out Thoros. That was only a taste of what was to come at the arrowhead mountain. Fighting each 'White' off one by one, it was only a matter of time until they all died, as Tormund nearly did, only to be saved by Dany and her three dragons. A rather easy fix you may say, until Daenerys loses one of her children, in one of the saddest Thrones' deaths of all time. Rest in peace Viserion.The very thought of having an Ice Dragon on the Night King's side is terrifying. Isn't it funny though that we all thought there may be a chance Jaime or Bronn were going to kill one a few weeks back? But the tables have turned. No longer can the people of Westeros think about the Throne, this is a time to set our eyes on what the Night King is doing. He has Walker Giants and now an Ice Dragon. How will anyone survive. This didn't stop the show from throwing in a few hints at things to come as Tyrion gave Dany a speech about succession and Jon held Dany's hand like he wanted to be her King. It's those things that are going to lay the groundwork for what's to come after the Night King is over and done with.On a different note, Arya and Sansa had a mental sparring session this week as the former lectured Sansa on how she should be acting and questioned her true intentions. At this point, these little fights seem entirely pointless and frustrating considering we know they aren't going to kill each other. Which is why it's unfortunate that there wasn't much movement on the Littlefinger front this week, other than him essentially asking Sansa to get rid of Brienne? I don't know, that whole side arc was weird and disappointing. Hopefully, next week will provide some clarity.Overall, it was yet another brutal week of Thrones, if only there was a little more surprises and less goofy sister talk. But as I said, having an Ice Dragon kind of tops everything.+Battle+Ice Dragon+Jon & Dany progressing+All the dynamics+Jon's resilience-Arya/Sansa stuff a little disappointing9.5/10",

As much as spectacular and at some points breathtaking this episode was, i was like \"NO FUCXXX WAY THIS IS POSSIBLE\" constantly during second half of this episode. I won't spoil it (although i would like to), but it is NOT possible any way it turned out here, even in a fantasy genre. I mean do they have like a GPS and teleport in that world? How much time it takes to simply travel in there?Now for 4 seasons \"Game of Thrones\" was the only show that almost literally could shock my and pulled a rug from viewers - it was unpredictable like anything out there. But from last season and especially this one, i do believe we will see a happy ending in this show overall. Sure some side characters will die, but it won't be as effective as in the past, because they don't have time to properly show it! This season is rushed as hell and i do believe that future book / books will be even more popular by simply telling this story in non rushed way.Overall, as much as spectacular \"Beyond the Wall\" was, i can not rate it any higher then 8 (and that is only because of great craftsmanship of the scenes) because of how unbelievably predictable it all turned out. And predictable in a most simple \"Hollywood style\", like we have seen in countless forgettable great looking movies. As it looks now, happy ending is not far away.",

                    "content": "Excellent episode from Game of Thrones. The story and scenes with the Wight Walkers are always captivating and chilling, no pun intended. The Night King is arguably one of the greatest foes in a TV History, without saying a single word and using his presence and gaze he has spoken volumes about the danger and harm he brings. The scenes, camera work with the Wight Walkers surrounding the small crew were great to watch. Arguably the best scene was the Night King using a glass spear to take down the dragon. Despite being a top episode I was also slightly disappointed. I found the close calls and scenes with Jon Snow and his men somewhat predictable. We somehow knew Jon Snow wouldn't die, that Danaery's would come to the rescue just in time and some even called it that the Dragon would be resurrected by the Night King since they took it beyond the wall. Not to mention the absurd plan to take a few men out to army of the dead to capture one soldier. As if they would stand idle while they took one. The King in the North who won the Battle of the Bastards should have known that was not the best of ideas and a suicide mission. My only hope is that it is a false sense of security and we can see some shocking events and even deaths. This is what makes GOT stand out for years, shocking deaths and big twists. I will off course await with eager anticipation for the finale which is where no punches are pulled.9/10",

But in the end though, this episode along with its follow-up The Dragon and The Wolf proved to still be a very good slice of television. Beyond the Wall has some impressive fight scenes but the sense of Deux Ex-Machina is noticeable (or maybe Lord of Light Ex-Machina); however there are set-ups for some of the things that happen. It's not all just coincidence, with the exception of Benjen Stark saving Jon Snow from the White Walker 'zombies'.Is this Season Seven's best? No. Is it the worst Game of Thrones episode? No. Is it flawed but still competently done storytelling? Yes; I'd certainly say so.The following episode is undoubtedly stronger in my eyes, but this one provides the set-up of a re-animated dragon set to blaze Westeros.",

                    "content": "Beyond the Wall isn't exactly a terrible episode. In fact, there are some things that saved it. As usual, the visuals/scenery is gorgeous, the performances are still good though not in the same league as in the previous seasons, the character interaction is nice, and some of the sequences particularly the White Walkers and the dragons along with Jon Snow and the others fighting the White Walkers are well done and Ramin Djawadi continues to compose some beautiful music.Unfortunately, there are some problems that made the episode more disappointing and my least favorite episode of the season next to Eastwatch. That episode was my least favorite too along with the sixth season episode No One, but at least they tried to do something interesting and while Unbowed, Unbent, Unbroken is also my least favorite, it was from my standpoint marginally better thanks to it's intensity and atmosphere. Sadly, the same thing can't be said here. The writing is bland and lacks the complexity that made the previous seasons so interesting, the pacing dragged on a bit too longer, the dialog isn't as fresh as the previous episodes, and most importantly, there weren't many surprises and plot twists.Now, this review isn't going be popular in the next few years and i'm very sorry to disagree with the rating on this website and the critical acclaim this episode received, but Beyond the Wall, despite some good moments, is my fourth least favorite (I might re-review No One from the sixth season someday to see if it holds up or now because many people didn't like it) and a disappointment to the seventh season. Hopefully the season finale might improve in my next review.",

This episode has to be watched carefully because there are some stories hidden in the episode that we can easily avoid. So look at my advice very carefully, there are family quarrels in this episode, there is death, there is transmission of life, there are monsters, there are monster oppressors. I will not say much about the rest. I will just say this. Watch this episode with your mind. Listen to each dialogue and try to understand the different parts of the story.

YEt there were zombies, so I am torn.The whole season seems to be a pointless romantic engagement between the fake blond tiny dragon queen and lil johnny snow. There's not even any real intrigue or good amount of progressive story to make it all feel worthwhile anymore, I just want it to end. The previous season had better pacing and more grit, and I began to dislike the show beforehand. Still we got what we expected, some more shots of the undead, a bit more cold north country, blah blah blah. And then came dragons, and what a disappointment they were. They stood no chance, when they could have easily burnt away the night king, but oh no they had to pull an \"eagles\" like move like the LOTR did to ferry the protagonists away in the nick o time. Then the undead somehow managed to find and use, as if outta thin air, enough giant steel chain to wrap around a small cruise liner, pulling the felled dragon from under the watery ice where it died. RIP OFF of World of Warcraft Lich King expansion much? Perhaps the scene is from a book in the franchise that was written and printed before WoW came out, but as this episode is near the end of the tale, I doubt it. BUt it is a TV adaptation, and I didn't read the book ( thank goodness)And in the end: ice dragon. There's only one more episode left in this short season, and though the zombies were cool, thats about all I am rating this so highly on. What happened to the ta tas?! T.T",

                    "content": "That time of year has come when Game of Thrones is up to their big second to last episode of the season, the spectacle of the season. This of course comes some 3 week earlier than normal due to the shorter season, but my excitement for it was tanished by that. For me the show has really started to vamp up in recent weeks so I couldn't wait to se what they could give us.It's rare I do this but I am going to start with some negatives of this episode, and by that I mean just one negative. This episode was amazing as expected, however there was two sides to this episode and one of them simply was not strong at all. The side I am talking about is of course Ayra and Sansa, more specifically Ayra herself. I said last week that I liked how Littlefinger was starting to build tension between the two sisters, however in this episode I didn't really like how it played out. There is always a chance that Ayra is playing Sansa and everything she said was all a game, but at this point I don't think this is the case. I thought the scene we got between the sisters were terrible. Ayra's writing was sloppy and it felt very unlike of Ayra. I know it is Littlefinger's job to start unnessarsary drame but in this episode I thought that Ayra really took that ball and ran with it.Negatives aside, and into the meat of this episode, the second side of the episode did enough for me to not only save this episode but make it memorable. In many ways we got what we wanted in a human vs dead fight but we got so much more than that.This episode did what Game of Thrones does great and throws in the unexpected. While I don't think things like Daenarys, Jon not dying or even Benjen coming to the rescue were completely unexpected, it is other things like the taking down of a dragon and being reborn to the dead that was completely unexpected. Like many people I was on the edge of my seat in shock like many others around the world. This changes the landscape of Game of Thrones. There are still three dragons out there, but one is the living dead.While still on the dragon attacks, the attack itself was a spectacle to watch. While I don't think it quite matched up to the first attack we saw earlier this season, it was great to see all the dragons in action for the first time.The end battle was always going to be the highlight of this episode but I thought there were still some great dialog scene, excluding that of Ayra and Sansa. I thought the scene with Tyrion and Daenarys was fantastically written and for me is going to be remembered as one of my favourite scenes of the season.Before wrapping up I want to talk about a theory that has been going around that Bran is the Night King. While I believe that in some way, Bran does have a connection to the Night King, I personally don't want it to happen. For me it is a situation of making the world feel too small. We already have a lot of intermingling between the families and everyone is connected to someone else in some way which I am okay with, just I want there to still be a part of Game of Thrones that is the unknown. We have seen Bran discovering stuff about the White Walkers and that has been interesting, but Bran being the Night King is a connection I do not want.Overall, another great penultimate episode of Game of Thrones. While I thought some of the B story line fell a little flat, it is hard to overlook three dragons killing a bunch of White Walkers, only for one of them to die and be reborn to the dead.8.5/10",

                    "content": "The very end of the episode is great; the battle is quite spectacular. But this episode is the culmination of everything that has gone terribly wrong with GoT ever since it went full Hollywood. You have great action, drama, a powerful ending, and yet everything happens in such a void of logic that it ends up being laughable and infuriating at the same time. To me anyway - a friend expressed the view that if you take it for what it is, just d&d (the other kind) low fantasy with battles between adventurers (+1d6 fire damage longswords) and undead it's still very enjoyable. But I think one ought to judge a show by the standards it sets.Most of \"Beyond the Wall\" is about Jon and his companions (plus a few extras who play the role of red-shirts) trying to capture a wight. In the only non-related plots, Tyrion tries to convince Hitler not to be a pyromaniac mass murdering tyrant, but she, expectedly, refuses to listen, while in Winterfell the showrunners have turned Arya into a really annoying person. There is honestly little reason for her animosity towards Sansa. On a sidenote, Jon, king in the north, declined to inform his people that you know what, I'm not on Dragonstone anymore, going north of the wall for a bit, brb.Anyway. The motley crew of adventurers starts off with some rather poor dialogue between Tormund and Sandor, and some trite, but better written, exchange between Beric and Jon. Soon after, they encounter a patrol of wights with one White Walker. He is easily killed, revealing VBI (Very Bad Idea) number 1: killing the white walker also destroys all the undead they have \"created\". A plot device which is usually a poor gimmick to heal vampirism or something is here turned into huge foreshadowing as later someone says \"if you kill the Night's King...\", pretty much telling us how the final battle will be resolved in disappointing fashion. Conveniently, one of the undead remains un- alive allowing the heroes to capture him, but his screams alert a much larger host to their presence. Then, Jon tells Gendry to run back to Eastwatch and send word to Daenerys that they got their prisoner. When this happened I was scratching my head, thinking this makes zero sense, as telling her you succeeded in the mission is only useful if you survive to produce him to the meeting. As events unfolded, I began to realise the point, as I reached the inescapable conclusion of just how shamelessly the situation would be resolved. You see, the undead surround the group, who reach an outcrop in the middle of a frozen lake. The lake collapses beneath the pursuers, trapping the group in the middle. But wait - there is hope in the form of VBI 2. Gendry reaches Eastwatch, sends a raven to Dragonstone, Daenerys comes pick them up. There are more things wrong with this than I can fit in an IMDb review, but let's start with the glaring obvious:1. an army of undead can arguably cross the lake. In fact, they later emerged from beneath the water. Besides, it's supposed to be really, really cold. They could probably guess that after a while, they're good to go. If not them, their bosses.2. Speaking of really, really cold. Our heroes were trapped for...under normal circumstances, it should be a week at the very least. In the distorted time-space continuum of D&D's terrible writing, it was let's say a day. Heck, make it 15 hours. They were standing almost still, exposed in Antarctic winter, for 15 hours, but hey, no problem. Ready to fight.3. Speaking of distorted time-space continuum, spare us. It would take longer to send a message and receive reinforcements if they were using cellphones and fighter aircrafts. Yes, I should be used by now to how the writers are unable to fathom distances and time, but it seems like things are getting stupider with every episode.4. As if that was not enough, Jon is left behind, because, for reasons beyond anyone's understanding, instead of climbing on the dragon with everyone else, he spends a few minutes fighting skeletons and then shouts \"leave without me\".5. But wait! There is more! He then falls into the frozen lake, but, you guessed it, climbs out. In fact, when he wakes up afterwards, he doesn't even have a running nose.6. Not done. Eagles in the form of dragons was not enough Deus ex Machina for one episode, so after climbing out of the lake, Jon is saved by Benjen Coldhands Stark, who just appears, gives him his horse and then re-dies(?) undeservedly.7. Bonus. Since it takes her 5 minutes, wouldn't \"let's just fly there so you can see the white walkers exist, and maybe grab a wight on the way\" have been a vastly better plan?Of course, the important thing is that when Daenerys comes to save them, the White Walkers throw a javelin and casually kill a dragon (Viserion, named after the disliked brother - even there they couldn't be original). A powerful scene, but the set up to it was so annoyingly lame that it loses strength.After the battle (and somewhere in the middle, talking with Tyrion) Daenerys shows she's falling for Jon, in a way more disgusting, cheesy and cheaply fan-servicing that I could believe. The actors are OK, they may even have chemistry. But it's so devoid of sense, so obviously made to appeal to the unthinking majority (and no other reason) that the whole thing seems like a parody.Of course, at the end, we get the White Walkers dragging the dragon out of the lake and turning him undead. Given that and the ease with which they killed him, one is inclined to believe them unstoppable. Sadly, obvious foreshadowing already spoiled the end.",

Now that the show has surpassed the books, we can clearly see the change in quality and not in the good way. You would think now that everyone is on the same plain field, one would think it would be easier to please everyone. Which is not the case, as the writing is just taking all the fans and anyone who has a brain for a joke. There is no longer time or distance in the show, no essence of danger, no shocks, no patience for the audience to understand or let the story progress in a normal way. Everything has to happen now and in each episode, with no time for the audience to feel anything. Now with this episode I have to call it, this is stupid. After looking into the game of thrones maps, and taking on board the distances between certain places have come out with the most shortest and fairest distance between Eastwatch and Dragonstone is around 1700-2000 miles. An average speed of flying bird is between 20-30 mph... Assuming here that the G.O.T ravens fly at 55 mph it would take the raven 31 hours just to get to Dragonstone. now also allowing the dragon to fly at 155 Mph with someone on their back not falling off, would mean that Daenerys flight back would be 11 hours if she flew with no stops and a map of exactly where to go to Eastwatch, not to mention where they are in behind the wall. Remember she's never been up north nor behind the wall. So in total that's 42 hours of straight flying with no breaks, stops or looking around for directions. In the episode we see the guys walk out of Eastwatch in the morning, they walked before capturing the walker, and when they told Gendry to run to Eastwatch it was evening. They got stuck on the frozen lake, and the next day they started to fight and got saved by the dragons. Now that means that less then 24 hours have had to pass. Assuming that they didn't start to fight in the early hours of the morning, at most 16 hours had past since Gendry left them. 16 hours vs 42 hours?? Come on G.O.T get your act together! If you need a new writer, feel free to contact me. Not to mention the fact that the whole surprise ending was not even funny. We know from previous episode that whatever dies get turned into the walker, they killed a polar bear at the beginning of the episode, and we have seen other animals be undead too. So why did fans were in shock when it happened? and didn't even ask the questions where the chains came from?...",

                    "content": "Came to 'Game of Thrones' fairly late in the game and due to being so busy the binge-watching was gradual. Have found myself truly loving the show, very quickly becoming one of my favourites. It totally lives up to the hype and not only does it do the brilliant source material justice (a rarity in television) it is on its own merits one of the finest, most addictive and consistently compelling shows in recent years and quality-wise it puts a lot of films in recent years to shame.Season 7 was by far the weakest and most frustratingly uneven season of 'Game of Thrones', with the only great episodes being \"The Queen's Justice\" and especially \"The Spoils of War\". The season sadly also boasted two of the show's worst episodes \"Eastwatch\" and \"Beyond the Wall\". \"The Dragon and the Wolf\" is certainly better than those two episodes, but it doesn't end the season with a bang, is the very meaning of an uneven episode and easily the weakest season finale of all the seasons. Of course \"The Dragon and the Wolf\" certainly has good things. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects are among the best of the latter season episodes.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The acting is, considering the material, quite good, though no tour-De-force performances. Like with all episodes, there are good moments in \"The Dragon and the Wolf\". The best being the powerhouse scene between Tyrion (given his best material in a while) and Cersei, the dragonpit meeting, the demolition of the wall and Cersei's decision. There are moments of passion and sensitivity in the writing, some character and plot advancing and a few revelations and answers provided. The acting is some of the best of the season, the standouts being Peter Dinklage, Lena Headey and especially Aidan Gillen. However, some other moments do not work. The worst being the dull, forced and childish romance between Jon and Daenerys, with a sex scene that served no real point and was just a cringe-worthy watch and Jaime's reaction to Cersei's decision which was out of character. Littlefinger deserved a much better final scene than the anaemic one he had, considering how great a character he was, while Jon and Euron are not very well written (Euron has been poorly written all season and Jon has gotten duller with each episode). The lineage revelation was not that much of a surprise. Pacing-wise, \"The Dragon and the Wolf\" felt rushed and jumpy, a general problem with Season 7, the characterisation has been meatier in other episodes and the writing continues to have what was particularly disappointing about it in the previous two episodes.Overall, not bad at all but uneven, that could have been grander and more fire-blazing considering it's a season finale. 7/10 Bethany Cox",

The scenes in King's Landing have more style and intrigue than in recent episodes and the meeting of pretty much all of the major characters is handled in a strong, efficient way that's true to each character in turn. You feel that the actors are given more to do in this episode, and although I don't like this season's Littlefinger sub-plot, at least Aiden Gillen and Sophie Turner have material to get their teeth into. The season also concludes with the best cliffhanger - almost literally - of its entire run, thus finishing things on a real high.",

With all the evil at work, we are shown forces for good and an effort to salvage the world. The wight is brought to Cersei and supposedly she is going to agree to fight for the common good. I wonder if she could sell used cars. Like truly benevolent people, those who met with her take her at her word. We have an interlude where Littlefinger's reign of dishonesty is put to the test. We find that blood is thicker than water when it comes to Arya and Sansa. Jaime, who has always been a truly complex character, shows us an honorable side. Jon Snow's lineage is revealed. Being a bastard is often what paints the good with a brush of evil when one looks at classic literature. How many good bastards are there in Shakespeare? Get my drift? But in any series, we have to have a hook to get us thinking about the next episode. I have to say that the final five minutes of this episode was as powerful as anything I've ever seen in cinema, any cinema. The cinematography, music, and special effects are nonpareil. And the writing, allowing us to match up forces that must settle everything is truly pregnant. It will be hard to match what happened here, but I have faith it will all be settled in the most professional way possible.",

The only remark is the discussion of on Jon Snow's lineage that deserved to be longer and better explained. But every segment is great and shows surprises, like Cersei and Sansa's decisions. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): \"The Dragon and the Wolf\"",

                    "content": "I don't think that I'm alone in thinking that this truncated seventh season of Game of Thrones is not as good in many ways as those that have gone before. In previous seasons I always enjoyed how they kept so many plots going, so many plates spinning, and were able to create engaging threads/characters with comparatively little screen time. They seemed to be able to make big things happen with short but meaningful interactions, while also allowing plenty of breathing room for some scenes or set pieces. That situation is very much reversed in this season, although it does have a lot to help balance it.The examples of this are numerous. They range from threads that don't really work because they lack detail of the character motivation, through to the 'fast-travel' element where characters seem to jump all around the map in hours rather than months (an element made more obvious by all of the previous seasons playing out most journeys over many episodes or seasons). Enough has been said about this, and I do sort of agree with those that question why viewers can suspend disbelief in dragons and undead armies, but can't just go along with the timelines \u2013 but for me it is that it undermines a solid base on which the fantasy show was built, and makes it broader and weaker.This broader and weaker elements do at least have plenty of good to counter it. The base of previous seasons, and investment in characters do help of course, but the compression of events has been used to cram a lot of large set pieces into the 7 episodes. These big moments are as memorable as they are narratively weak; again there are many examples, but the one that stuck with me was the field of fire \u2013 a brutal battle which does a great job of flipping us emotionally to feel for the Lannisters, but then ends with Jamie somehow surviving and then swimming underwater for miles to pop up at the start of the next episodes (and seemingly nobody thought to try to capture him or check if he was dead). This sort of thing is common in big moments and small interactions \u2013 in the bigger picture it is still good and engaging, but there is also something, or some omission, that undercuts how effective it all is.I don't see the problem going away soon; the final season will only be 6 episodes, although I hope they will not all be limited to 60 minutes. Looking at the scale of what remains to be played out and resolved, it looks impossible (unless they use the same 'on-screen text' device that Quantum Leap used to tie it all up). Of course I will be there to end the story and enjoy the scale, spectacle, and drama of the bigger picture \u2013 but the years in-between will also send me back to watch previous seasons again, where characters had more time, and drama played out at a more satisfying pace.",

It is not as easy discussion as certain people refuse to make promises they cannot keep and others make promises they don't intend to keep. Back in Winterfell Lord Petyr Baelish is attempting to poison Sansa against her sister leading to a trial that doesn't quite go as expected. Also at Winterfell Sam arrives and a conversation with Bran about Jon leads to a surprising revelation. Further north the Army of the Dead have arrived at The Wall and the war between the living and the dead finally begins.This episode got off to a fine start; there was good some verbal sparring as various antagonists meet before the captured Wight is shown to the assembly. We then get some interesting negotiating as we see how much various characters value their word... not that this is too surprising. The events at Winterfell did provide a surprise and those complaining that no long serving character has died for ages should be pleased... unless of course they think the wrong character died. It looked as if the action would be limited to the demonstration of how to kill a Wight and a one on one fight between Theon and an Iron Islander who didn't agree with his plan to rescue his sister... then we get the attack on the wall; even though the 'big surprise' was not that surprising it was still spectacular. If there was a weakness in the episode then it was probably the sex scene between Jon and Daenerys as it didn't really add anything and took us away from more important matters. The cast were on good form, most notably Aidan Gillen who was great as Lord Baelish, one of the series most enjoyable characters. Overall a great season conclusion; I can't wait for season eight.",

In reality, we knew Cersei wasn't actually going to go along with the truce, we figured Littlefinger would meet his end sooner rather than later, it was all but confirmed that Jon was the son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and it was inevitable that the wall (or one section of the wall) was going to come down by season's end. So really, the 4 biggest shocks or twists from the episode weren't all that surprising, but it's the execution that counts. If there's one thing that Game of Thrones always does right, it's the execution.Starting off in King's Landing, because everything always comes back there, we got at least a half an hour of extraordinary direction and writing. I think a lot of people have complained about this season revolving around dialogue instead of things actually happening, but I eat all this dialogue up. How can you not appreciate all of the brilliant blocking in the dragon pit? There's so many dynamics, so many reunions, and so many important meetings. The Hound and The Mountain, Theon and Euron, Jaime and Brienne, and of course the long- awaited meeting between Daenerys and Cersei. There's so much to cover in such little time, and I thought the writers handled it brilliantly. We didn't get Cleganebowl, but everyone did finally see the real threat that's out there. The moment that everyone sees that wight is probably the most significant thing to happen on this show to date (which has been said a lot the past two seasons). All the back and forth, including an emotional discussion between Tyrion and Cersei, led to the result of Cersei ultimately agreeing to fight alongside Dany & company in the great war. Only to then secretly betray them. Classic Cersei. Luckily, Jaime finally gathered up the strength to go against his sister and love of his life, to head north to fight. It's the redemption we've all wanted from him from the get-go. By the way, where's Bronn? I don't believe I saw him join Jaime so we can only assume he's chilling in some brothel somewhere. Meanwhile, everyone made their way back up north traveling via boat (and not dragonback). This is where we find Jon and Daenerys doing what some people have wanted them to do for a very long time. I'm honestly not sure how I feel about it. It's disgusting for one, but this is a fantasy show that has presented such intimate relationships more of the norm than it should be. Plus, it's not like these characters know that they're related\u0085.yet. Yes, Bran has finally spilled the beans. God knows why he told Sam of all people and not his own siblings. But I guess they had their own quarrels to worry about. Speaking of which\u0085.Rest in peace Littlefinger! Well, sort of. It's not like he was a good person, in fact, he rarely ever did anything of value. But I will definitely miss his character, and I'll certainly miss Aidan Gillen, who's one of the few original cast members to die in the past few seasons. Which brings up that \"issue\" if you can call it that. How is this show going to service all of the remaining characters and their inevitable deaths in a mere 6 episodes next season? I think there's maybe a dozen characters, maybe, who are safe till the end of the show's run. But I can imagine at least a couple every episode being killed off next season. I don't think I can wait 2 years for that.Things to look forward to next year: Jaime fighting with the good guys! Jon finding out the truth. Cersei messing everything up. The Night King kicking a**. The inevitable queen-slayer moment. Arya crossing a few more names off her list? And of course, Jon being too damn honorable. Oh and by the way, it's snowing in King's Landing. It was a quick season, but definitely one of the best ones yet, if not the best. Let's hope next season gets here faster than we think.+Starks finally stick together+Everyone in King's Landing+Cersei stays evil+Jaime's redemption begins+Jon & Dany+Baelish says farewell+Down goes the wall10/10",

We kind of expected certain moments such as Cersei going back on her word and Jon and Daenery's becoming an item but it was the beautiful execution and delivery that made this a great finale. Perhaps the best moment was the end of Littlefinger, this death was satisfying and overdue. A number of fans loved this character but it was good to see him finally taken out and by the dagger he used to lie and set two major houses against each other. The Night King and his army of the dead taking down part of the wall and marching past was well executed and a treat to watch. While we knew about Jon Snow's lineage it was nice to add more to the theory, he is not a bastard after all. Season 7 has now sadly concluded. It contained 7 quality episodes, some were far better than others. I and I'm sure many other fans felt the pace and/or intensity would increase but we didn't see this so much. With only 6 episodes to go now to wrap the show up it seems the final season will have to convey volumes and intensity could be the constant. Now the long wait begins for our beloved show, I thought waiting one week for the next episode was bad but 1.5 years seems brutal.9/10",

This could be screened at the cinemas and could passed up for a feature film thanks to its cinematic pacing, 81-minute runtime and scale of an epic movie. The Dragon and The Wolf had so many great moments in it, from Cersei seeing the white walker, to the revelation that Jon Snow is the heir to The Iron Throne, this episode is chock full of moments sure to become classics in television history; and I haven't even mentioned Petyr Baelish's death scene, which was beautifully satisfying stuff.If there's anything wrong with this episode, it's that we may have to wait until 2019 to see television's best show finish its ambitious story. That'll be a sad day when Game of Thrones is finally over. Until then, we can rewatch the previous seasons over and over and speculate endlessly as to what will happen in the end.10/10; a modern classic.",

Bran Stark should have been able to see this happen as well as the Night King dragging the dead Viserion out from under the ice as a past vision.King of the North Jon Snow (Aegon Targaryen) and Queen Daenerys Targaryen need to evacuate across the Sea and let the Night King and his White Walker Armies wipe out Queen Cersei Lannister and her Allies.Surely they know that the Night King got dead Viserion from Bran Starks visions. And must have built lots of anti dead dragon Ballistas with shafts tipped with Dragon Glass. Numbers built 100 each Ballistas with 20 dragon glass tipped bolts.Small arrow head made of a shard of Dragon Glass (not shaped like time consuming typical arrow heads)same width as arrow shaft placed into notch and bound, then shaped into a point, not small knives that use too much Dragon Glass and must be too close to be of any use (when there are hundreds of thousands of White Walkers). All (Population Millions, including children) make these total numbers made, Hundreds of Millions.Heavy spears tipped with Dragon Glass shards, heavy spears were used to stop Cavalry Charges, Massive Infantry Charges. Bottom of Heavy Spear Shaft pushed into ground, heavy spear held at an angle, enemy impales themselves. Wooden shaft length about 10 feet to 15 feet, diameter 1.5 inches to 2 inches. Those holding the heavy spears are also equipped with short spears to stab those that squeeze between the less than a few inches apart or crawl under the Heavy Spears. On the attack they form into a Phalanx Formation with archers and short spear men protecting their flanks and rear.Short spears tipped with a Dragon Glass shard, not swords that will use up too much Dragon Glass. Short spears were used in close combat against swords as longer than swords to stab the enemy while out of sword reach, movement of position of hands means can be used during hand to hand combat. Shaft can be easily be used as a club, bat. Can be thrown with accuracy similar to the Agrianian peltast javalin.",

Yes the sex scene between Jon Snow and Daenerys felt out of place and the pacing was quite uneven this time around, but there are other things to like.The scenery is still gorgeous, the visual effects are still beautiful, the directing and editing is sharp, and Ramon Djawadi continues to make more beautiful music. And most of all, the acting is still great with the best coming from Lena Heady, Peter Dinklage, and Aiden Gillen in great scenes including the conversation between Tyrion and Queen Cersei about what happened in the fourth season which and Littlefinger finally getting what he deserved ever since the first season where he manipulated everyone including the Stark family. With him gone, however, who else will survive in the battle against the White Walkers for all the seven kingdoms? That question will be answered when season 8 comes.Overall, a great episode and while it's not as strong as the other season finales, it's still worthy for those who continue to love this show.

Yes, this shorter, more eventful, seven-episode arc could seem a little rushed when compared with prior seasons. And certain plot points in the last several episodes here are easy to nitpick.But I can't give less than a perfect rating to a show that I enjoyed this much. Season 7 added great action and special effects, lots of momentum, frightening horror, and some long-awaited conclusions to story arcs that began back in Season 1. And the show still has the best dialogue of any current television show that I'm aware of, usually supported by terrific acting.I won't say more for fear of spoilers.

When I want to be messed with, I go see a film by M. Night shama however you spell his name. Though I keep watching G.o.T. , there is so little tangible fantasy content in other media I cant tell why I am still watching. Cause it is not to say that Thrones really has that much magic at all.If you look at the Lord of the Rings franchise, it is bland compared to some things that have come in recent years, but as the progenitor of modern fantasy, its still chock full of more magic and fantasy elements than Game of Thrones. Yet why is G.o.T so popular with lackluster season finales like this?!A conference to speak is held between the remaining powers of the continents, except for the one central bank in the world that is happy sitting back and growing fatter off of whomever is left to do business with. Oh but don't fret, there's undead and an ice dragon, yes. At the end of the entire episode. It seems like way too much of this franchise is just spent with frivolous banter that is little more than verbal masterbation. Whole seasons are little more than cheap stepping stones to a single pivotal season, that then transitions back into a season of little consequence once more. This is poor plot creation. At least put some more ample sized breasts on some 20 something year old women. We don't need more male appendages in an HBO show, hell throw some lady parts in there, my eyes are thirsty :P. This show had better end by season 8, because if I wanted to get jerked around, I would just do it myself watching something that actually promises boobs and lady parts.",

                    "content": "Absolutely love 'Game of Thrones', which at its best made for one of the best and most addictive shows in recent years and one of my favourites. This was when gradually binge-watching when first starting watching the show, just under two years ago, with so many of my friends recommending it to me. The source material is brilliant and wholly deserved to be adapted in a way that did it justice, and the show more than does that and stays true to its written roots.When at its best, so Seasons 1-5, one had to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. For me, and many others it seems (some people even dislike it, didn't think it was that bad myself), Season 7 was uneven and frustratingly so, boasting the only great episodes being \"The Queen of Justice\" and \"The Spoils of War\" but also two of the show's worst episodes (\"Eastwatch\" and \"Beyond the Wall\"). It is too early to tell how Season 8 is as a season as it has only just started. On the most part, \"Winterfell\" was not a bad episode at all from personal opinion. It is nowhere near 'Game of Thrones' at its best and has a few big problems that were present in Season 7 and had the opportunity to be corrected here but weren't, but at the same time there is a lot to recommend and it serves its purpose well.Starting with the things that could have been done better, one of \"Winterfell's\" weaker assets is the writing. It is not terrible, but underwhelming. It is thought-probing and has passion and sensitivity in parts but lacks nuance and felt childish at times and didn't always flow. Didn't think the attempts at humour were welcome and instead were out of place.Momentum was not always there either, it can be slight structurally and at times feels like the show's running out of material and over-stretching itself. It is a deliberately paced episode, purposefully, and did have times where it did feel too slow and could have done with more tension. The characters are still interesting, serve their purpose in the episode well and are well acted (a great job was done with Samwell), but to me the way they were written was far meatier before (Tyrion being a big example), actually did not think there was quite enough time to get to know or familiarise with them properly with so many of them and their subplots.However, there is an awful amount to recommend \"Winterfell\". Even if the episode didn't do much for me, it still would have gotten a personal rating of 5 at least because the good things were so brilliantly done. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects, while not the very best of the show, put many recent shows and films to shame. One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.It has been said that the writing and characterisation has been much better before, but as said too the writing was far from a mess and the characterisation did interest, with Sam showing a lot of complexity and a wide range of emotions and a lot of it is down to John Bradley's intensely deeply felt performance. He is the standout when it comes to the writing, which was good and even more than that throughout and all round, though only he really comes close to being a tour de force. The storytelling does well in achieving its aim, which was to set up the season, introduce chess pieces and put them into place. This is not a bloodthirsty and full of action sort of episode, there is a quieter and more reflective tone and although some may not think so perhaps to me 'Game of Thrones' has excelled equally well in the quieter episodes as it did in the more action-heavy and weightier kind of story-lines. Alliances are formed, any reunions are nostalgic, nothing really felt padded and there is story advancing if not quite character advancing (this is not a filler episode and is an important one for setting the season up). Furthermore, it was great to feel refreshed in re-knowing the characters and what had happened to them before instead of spending the whole time confused, something that is something of a miracle considering how long it's been since the previous season (Season 7) and my increasing problems with memory recently. The standout was Jon and Arya's meeting, which was also the highlight of the episode and was surprisingly tender.On the whole, not a bad episode at all but an uneven one. 7/10",

Generally it works well, although Arya's still oddly off and there's at least one childish and stupid interlude, the dragon flying sequence between Jon and Daenerys, which feels like it belongs in a Disney film - a shame that CGI budget didn't get added to episode three. Otherwise, this is well directed and entertaining, with lots of interesting meeting and dialogues between characters who haven't seen each other for years. A set-up episode, for sure, but one that works.",

But there are highly significant facts revealed that are necessary to set up what will transpire in the other five episodes.

As the episode opens Jon Snow and Daenerys arrive; they don't get quite the welcome they hoped for... many there aren't happy that Jon has bent the knee and accepted Daenerys as the rightful queen of all of Westeros. The meeting of forces means that several characters who haven't seen each other for a few seasons are reunited. Back in King's Landing Euron Greyjoy arrives and meets with Cersei; while he is ashore Theon moves to rescue his sister Yara.In many ways this episode feels like it is there just to remind us of who all the key characters are and how they feel about each other... something few fans will need even if it is a while since they watched the previous episode. Apart from Theon's rescue operation there is little in the way of violent action; this was one of the episodes main highlights. Other highlights include Daenerys telling Sam that she had executed his father and brother for failing to support her; Arya and The Hound meeting again and some banter between Tyrion and Lord Varys. As one would expect the acting is solid and special effects are top notch. Overall a decent enough season opener that acted to set things up for what is to come and nicely raised tensions between some characters who are allies for the time being.",

It returned for what was for all intents and purposes a slowly paced episode, but one that needed to be that way. I mean heck, we got Jon riding a flipping Dragon and no one is even talking about that, instead, we are discussing the endless amount of reunions this week.Tyrion & Sansa, Jorah & Sam, Arya & Jon, Arya & Gendry, Arya & The Hound, Theon & Yara, Sam & Jon, Jon & Bran, and finally Jaime and Bran. That's a whole heck of a lot of screen time dedicated to dialogue between characters.Let's begin with where the season, and quite frankly the show, begins, which is at Winterfell. I love the callbacks via aesthetic to the first episode when King Robert arrives at Winterfell, just as Jon & Dany arriving side by side, come North. They even used the exact same theme that Ramin Djawadi used for Robert's arrival all those years ago. One shouldn't be surprised that Dany didn't receive the warmest of welcomes from Sansa and crew. Sansa in these scenes reminds me a lot of how Cersei acted around Margaery, does she not? Cold, cautious, and weary of what it could mean for her family, and she is clearly taking what she learned from Cersei and using it against Dany right now. I can't imagine that will stick, but it's worth mentioning.Speaking of Dany, she went through quite a bit last night. Finding out, ever so briefly, that one of her dragons is a part of the Night King's army now amidst finding out that Jon's best friend is the brother and son of two Tarly's she burnt alive last season. I love that this sequence comes right after Jon tells Sansa \"she will be a good Queen, she's not her father\" just as Sam finds out the horrors that his family went through via fire and blood.Arya & Jon had a sweet moment together, a clear callback to Season 1 Episode 2 in which Jon gives Arya 'Needle', now having Jon show her his sword, Longclaw. She also ran into Gendry & The Hound once again, both quick but well handled snippets of screen time that I sure hope we get more of this season.Jon rode a dragon! Admittedly way sooner than i figured and not in the same context as I thought, but it will still neat. The scene was the only one I felt a little bit off about, as it was merely there to re-establish their romance, not all that necessary to the plot as of now.Have we talked about how creepy Bran is? What was there like 5 scenes in this episode where he was just lingering in the background staring at people? \"waiting for an old friend\"....ahhh very unsettling. Lastly a few other tidbits worth mentioning: Theon save Yara (that quickly?), Yara provided us with context as to where everybody may stay after the Battle of Winterfell is inevitably lost, Cersei bed with Euron, The Night King sped through Last Hearth, Bronn received an offer from Cersei to kill her brothers, and Jaime arrived in Winterfell. I cannot wait to see how that plays out next week.9.5/10",

Do not believe that the Night King can reanimate ashes to fight. As more Strategic than the Dragons. They also need Cersei Lannister's anti dragon huge crossbows (\"ballista\") with many dragon glass tipped bolts (arrows) to eliminate Night King's dragon Viserion.Need the help of The Red Woman Melisandre.",

With only one season left they update the intro sequence to something even more beautiful than the previous ones. At first after seeing the length of the episode, only 50 minutes I thought it would be too short but after watching through it I found it perfect as it had everything I wanted but more, leaving us excited for the big battle of Winterfell. Gorgeous cinematography and visual effects in this episode.Some of my favorite moments of the episode was honestly seeing a lot of people getting reunited and it was predictable but the dialogue for the scenes were perfect. Now I'm hoping that Littlefinger will make a comeback, there is a small possibility. Superb episode, close to a 10.",

Jon Snow brings Daenerys to her sisters and Bran Stark witnesses Jaime Lannister.The first episode is a decent start, although not without it's problems. The pacing felt pretty slow and lacks momentum, the writing and characterizations are fine although it lacks the spark of the previous seasons where they brought some thought-provoking poignancy and pathos to the characters.That being said, everything else is very good. The acting continues to be superb the best coming from Kit Harrington, Emilia Clarke, and Peter Dinklage, the cinematography is still beautiful along with some great costumes, the character interactions continue to amuse especially the part where Jon Snow flies one of Daenerys' dragons, and the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still great as he continues to create a sense of atmosphere especially with, like I said, in reviews of the previous episodes, the relationships.Overall, not a perfect start, but decent enough for the final season.",

Be patient, you will see what you want to see. When it comes to acting, everyone has acted really well. It has to be said that the dialogues of the episode are a little weak.

                    "content": "At its very best, so the best of Seasons 1-5 mainly, 'Game of Thrones' made for one of the best and most addictive shows on television and even when gradually binge-watching it became a personal favourite. The source material is brilliant and wholly deserved to be adapted in a way that did it justice, and the show more than does that and stays true to its written roots.With Seasons 1-5, one had to actually check that it was made for television when everything is done to such a high level that it puts many films made today to shame. Season 7 was disappointing and frustratingly uneven, with only two great episodes (especially \"The Spoils of War\") but two of the show's worst episodes came from that season too (\"Eastwatch\" and \"Beyond the Wall\"). Am aware that many fans were disappointed by the eighth season premiere \"Winterfell\", to me although the writing and pacing could have been much better there was a lot to recommend it. Despite being dismissed as another filler episode by some, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" was a big improvement.It was the pace that was \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" weakest element. It has been said by people criticising the pacing that the writers were running out of material, although it is an improvement over \"Winterfell\" in this regard momentum is not always there and felt over-stretched in parts.Yet \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" did a great job putting what was introduced in the previous episode into place and setting up what is to come in calm before the storm fashion. It may lack forward momentum narratively but personally do not consider it a \"filler\" episode. It does equally well at distinguishing the battle's two sides, bringing all the major characters together in one setting (Winterfell in this case), character advancing, subtly tense reconciliations, tying up loose ends and providing emotional intimate moments.Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects, while not the very best of the show, put many recent shows and films to shame. One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Writing is a big improvement here over \"Winterfell\". It flows much better and is far less chilidish and has more nuance. The pace is not perfect, but the story is intriguing enough and there are some lovely character moments. The standout is Brienne's knighting, which was for me the most emotional 'Game of Thrones' moment in a long time. Like \"Winterfell\", there is a quieter and more reflective tone and although some may not think so perhaps to me 'Game of Thrones' has excelled equally well in the quieter episodes as it did in the more action-heavy and weightier kind of story-lines. As well as being a set-up putting things into place episode, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" is also character driven, and it's this that's one of the episode's strongest assets. Some lovely character development, especially Jaime and Brienne and the tension between Sansa and Daenerys intrigues highly, the reconciliations are nostalgic and the interactions intense and emotional. All the acting is strong.Altogether, not a perfect episode but a big improvement over last week, made me eagerly anticipating the next one and for me it's one of the better episodes since the show became uneven. 9/10",

As that time approaches the characters prepare, knowing that for some, possibly all of them it will be their last night alive.This episode may feature none of the violent action associated with the series but instead we are treated to a great character driven episode. Time is given to each of the characters assembled at Winterfell as they ready themselves for battle. They discuss their prospects and some wonder what will happen next should they survive. This leads to some genuinely touching scenes; most notably the scene which culminates in the knighting of Brienne. The cast are all on great form; it is impossible to single out any of them for specific mention without listing all the main cast, and some of the secondary cast. As I write this I've not seen the next episode so have no idea who will survive but this episode left be wishing they all could even though it wouldn't be 'Game of Thrones' if they did! Overall a really fine character led episode.",

                    "content": "It's come to the point of this show where I can watch reunions and first meetings for hours and never get tired of it. I get it, the show has done 2 straight weeks of \"set up\", but it seems completely fitting to me. Even after all of the long-awaited reunions we got last week, we still needed some time to breathe with these characters for another week in Winterfell.First thing of note is that this episode was set entirely in Winterfell, no Iron Islands with Yara or King's Landing with Euron/Cersei. And to be honest, do we expect either setting to fit in next week either? If it's supposed to be an episode entirely on the battlefield, than there's no reason to show any other setting. It's safe to say they were not missed tonight.As expected, the episode began with Jaime in front of all the Lords, Kings, and Queens left in Winterfell as he \"atoned\" for his past sins. It wasn't all that shocking or surprising, we knew the people who would stand up for him (Tyrion & Brienne), the people who would not (Sansa & Daenerys) and the one in between (Bran), but it was nonetheless thrilling to watch. There were two lines that specifically stood out to me. The first being Brienne saying Jaime is a \"Man with honor\", which is a touching callback to the episode in season 2 titled \"A Man Without Honor\" in which she refers to Jaime as such. The second being Bran ending the conversation with \"The things we do for love\", talk about callbacks. I truly can't get enough of this.Jaime and Brienne had quite a week together (which really worries me for both of their fates in the coming weeks), with Jaime asking Brienne to serve under her in the battlefield, and then him knighting her later in the episode in what was one of the most touching scenes this show has ever given us. How nice was it to see Brienne smile a bit in that sequence? Of all the titles people receive in this show, making Brienne a knight is at the top of the list.Another quick but touching scene was seeing Theon return to Winterfell and pledge his sword to Sansa once more. I nearly teared up, not going to lie. I truly believe Alfie Allen is one of the best actors on this show, always showing so much emotion with little dialogue over the years. It didn't take much for his and Sophie Turner's reaction to him arriving to move me significantly in this moment. Of course, this comes directly after the \"make-up\" scene between Sansa and Dany, which was surely welcomed. But it wouldn't be Game of Thrones without those finally few seconds of Sansa asking about what will happen to the North once it's all over. How many times are people going to bring up \"afterwards\" without realizing that this show never gives us good happy endings/happy \"afterwards\"!I loved seeing everyone surround the table and plan for the battle, and I also loved that it wasn't just Jon providing insight. It's an Avengers style lineup in this scene, and it was nice seeing everyone from Jaime, Sansa, Tormund, and Bran step up here. Which brings up the next point that we got an answer of sorts as to what the Night King wants, which is Bran. Is Bran's purpose only so that people knew of Jon's true lineage? Does he meet his end at the hands of the Night King in the next episode, thus eliminating the \"world's memory\"? Is that why Jon told Dany in this episode (because he needed to do it while Bran was still alive)? So by wanting an \"endless night\" does he need to kill absolutely everyone? Or is he satisfied once he kills Bran? I'm sure that's not the case, but still, so many questions left to answer. Some other notes worth mentioning:-GHOST -the baby is real?? -Tormund is the MVP -Shocked Jon told Dany already -Pod is a singer -Arya got her weapon....in more than one way tonight... -\"And now our watch Begins\" -Davos & the people -Theon will definitely die next week10/10",

One has to take a step back and appreciate the reunions and interactions we are seeing. Dothraki, Unsullied, Wildlings, Northmen, Jaimie, the Watch and 3 dragons all under the same room. This episode worked well to bring these worlds together. I like how we briefly saw Ser Jorah and the new head of house Mormont have that encounter. Also great leadership is allowing them to work together. The dialogue is top notch and what you'd expect from GOT. It is a great build up to an epic battle that lies episode.

                    "content": "There have been so many great episodes in this series, but for me this was the most enjoyable one. It's a wonderful episode largely for the character moments and there are many. The episode was written by Bryan Cogman a series veteran who's been on GOT since season one, and directed by David Nutter the most prolific director on the series who won an Emmy for the episode Mother's Mercy.We start off with Jaime's trial before the leaders of the combined forces at Winterfell. I thought it was a great performance by Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and the rest of the cast, great interplay with Tyrion, Sansa, Daenerys and Brienne before Jon has the final word. This is followed up by the first face to face meeting between Jaime and Bran since the infamous ending of the first episode of the series.Next we have an intriguing conversation between Sansa and Daenerys which goes quite well until the discussion turns to the future after the upcoming battle. It is also interrupted by return of Theon to Winterfell and his offer to Sansa to fight for them. Good moments and strong performances again by all three.The war council scene is important for Bran's revelation that the Night King will be coming after him and because of the mark placed upon he will be easy to find, so he will wait in the God's Wood. This scene did not stand out particularly for me, but is important for the story as it has Theon and the Iron Born vow to defend Bran, while Jon and Daenerys plan to spring a trap.This is followed by a very enjoyable encounter between Arya and the Hound in which she confronts him about his motives, this harkens back to their time together in Seasons 3 & 4 and how much Clegane has changed. This follows the infamous encounter between Arya and Gendry that made complete sense on the eve of battle and allows a very human interaction for a character that has become an instrument of death despite her young age. Good performances again from all three.And then we have the standout scene of the episode with Jaime, Brienne, Tyrion, Podrick, Davos and Tormund together on the eve of battle at the hearth in Winterfell. There are some wonderful character moments, including Tormund and Brienne's awkwardness, some great discussions and an emotional song from Podrick. But the standout moment of the scene and the episode is Jaime knighting Brienne despite the convention that a woman cannot be knighted.The final major scene has Daenerys confronting Jon (who has been distancing himself from her since the revelation in the previous episode) in the crypts in front of the statue of his mother Lyanna Stark, and Jon's revelation of his true parentage which Daenerys recognizes as superseding her claim to the Iron Throne. Another great reaction scene for Emilia Clarke.There are also a number of powerful minor scenes. With the return of Tormund, Beric and Edd we get a brief reunion between Jon, Samwell and Edd reminiscing about their time together with the Night Watch and those they have lost. Another nice scene has Lady Lyanna Mormont informing he cousin Jorah that she will not be retreating to the crypts as she is the leader of her house. Finally we have Samwell presenting his family's Valyrian sword to Jorah because of the influence Jorah's father had upon Sam and because Jorah would be much better suited to the sword which Samwell couldn't wield. himself.",

                    "content": "Have always absolutely loved 'Game of Thrones'. When it was at its best, it kept me glued, although it was a gradual binge watch with so much going on, and was seriously addictive. The best episodes were as brilliant as television can get. It did justice to the equally brilliant source material, wholly deserving to be adapted, and mostly stays true to it despite the odd controversial moment/scene.This mainly applies to Seasons 1-5, while Season 7 was uneven with only two great episodes (\"The Spoils of War\" being the best) while boasting two of 'Game of Thrones' worst episodes. So far Season 8 has a fair share of truly impressive elements, but have yet to be properly blown away as an overall whole. It has so far been a divisive season understandably with strong opinions on both sides for all three episodes, fit in neither love or hate category just to say as indicated already. Am aware that many fans were disappointed by the eighth season premiere \"Winterfell\", to me although the writing and pacing could have been much better there was a lot to recommend it. Despite being dismissed as another filler episode by some, \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" was a big improvement and the best of the three episodes. A distinction that the highly anticipated \"The Long Night\" should have been and this was the episode that should have blown me away. Yet, although there are things done exceptionally it didn't.Beginning with the faults, ones that are shared with pretty much all of those who didn't care or outright hated the episode, the biggest one is the lighting. Even when advised to alter the settings on my television to maximum effect, much of the episode, especially in the action, was far too dark which did induce some squinting and confusion. The conclusion of the White Walkers is too premature and the Night King (looks great and sinister enough in his too limited screen time, but there was a big missed opportunity in making him more interesting) exit also underwhelms massively, much too rushed, introduced too abruptly, very anti-climactic, almost incomplete and done in a way that's too convenient.After improving quite a lot in \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\", the writing takes a nose-dive. Not the dialogue, which is far less childish than in \"Winterfell\", provoked thought and was sincere, but more in how the characters behave and what they are given to do. Too many either being underused or being seemingly invincible in an implausible way. Bran is completely useless, if you are going to have a character at least give him something to do and have a story-line that is interesting, neither the case here. Again, there is a sense of running out of material.However, all those faults aside, \"The Long Night\" does have exceptional qualities. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects, while not the very best of the show, put many recent shows and films to shame. The dragons are extremely well rendered here. One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film.Regarding the action, despite the lighting it is thrilling and does shock and wrench the gut. The quieter moments of the episode don't drag and handled sincerely and with a lot of thought. The episodes handles both well, great to have both action-packed and quiet rather than one or the other. On an emotional level, there is a lot to digest and will admit that tears did well up in my eyes. The characterisation is interesting, one can really see the effort in the direction and the acting is dead on from all.On the whole, \"The Long Night\" did not blow me away but can totally see the monumental effort that was put into it and it is not an episode that will be forgotten by me. 7/10",

It's magnificent stuff, superbly shot and with excellent visuals throughout, visuals that stun particularly when watched on Blu-ray as compared to the spotty streaming version I originally watched back in 2019. The siege warfare is handled adroitly and the character beats are just fine, but it's the special effects which really make this zing. Sure, there aren't enough character deaths here - main contenders like Tyrion, Arya, Sam and Brienne should have all been for the chop at least - and it's all tied up a little too neatly at the climax, but generally this works a treat as a truly cinematic viewing experience.",

I assumed several were dead by their peril at the end of a scene. One of my problems is that even though I have a very good TV with precise definition, everything was so dark. Often, it was impossible to tell who was being killed or where the battle was going. Also, lots of things were quite disjointed. Too many cuts without finality. I still enjoyed it but there was a repetitiveness that finally was too much. Bring on the evil queen. This is going to be fun.",

Dark and fog and suggestions and pyramids of bodies and cries and blue fire and poor Samwell who could be dead or alive and a dragon in ambiguous status and so easy death of the Big Bad Guy and Bran with the world of him and a house fall and the brave and honest Theon keeping the so long expected end of his life as a sort of prize. Off course, the cinematography is impressive but this is not exactly a surprise after seven seasons. And the death of Meander is poetic. But, for me , it was like the gift for birthday. Lovely promisses. A symbolic present. Short, tension, emotions. And nothing more.",

Once the action starts it is almost none-stop as the battle rages around, and later within, Winterfell.I found this to be one of the best episodes of the series so far; the action is spectacular and I genuinely had no idea who would survive... I had a good idea but still feared for all the key characters as they face potentially overwhelming odds. One might argue that too often key characters survived when they should die but that didn't bother me too much. The way the action moves from location to location within the battle meant things never got monotonous as well as keeping us up to date with all key characters. It was great seeing Arya Stark battling as hard as anybody and Theon Greyjoy fighting to try to protect Bran from the Army of the Dead and even the Night King himself... not to mention how a dead-giant was dispatched! The battle scenes, particularly those early in the episode were a little on the dark side but that just added to the confusion and chaos one would get in a pitched battle at night. Overall I'd say this was a great episode... just try to watch it in a very dark room so it is easier to see what is going on!",

Even Jon seemed shocked who witnessed it happen already, you simply can't retreat and the plan should be for a lot of people to be targeting the Night King, otherwise it's pointless. They got slaughtered and yet everyone important survives, except Jorah at the end. Seems like a lot of build up, to have Arya with a surprise attack out of nowhere, oh, it's all over.Arya, The Hound, Jon and Sansa the standouts.",

                    "content": "For all of the predictions I made about The Battle of Winterfell, the only one I was absolutely spot on about was that the episode would be titled 'The Long Night'. This show from the very beginning (and the books too for that matter) has always been about subverting expectations, so I really do appreciate the showrunners sticking to that notion for what may be their biggest episode of all time. I knew before the season based on the directors announced that episode 3 and 5 would be battle weeks (Miguel Sapochnik is directing after all), but I figured in some way shape or form, The Night King was going to be involved in both battles. I mean the show wouldn't miss out on the opportunity to bring 'Winter' to King's Landing right?Rian Johnson's tweet last night summed up fandom pretty nicely as he said \"god***it I had this whole amazing Night King theory\", which is essentially a nod to Star Wars fandom overreacting to Snoke's death in Episode 8. Alas, they actually did it, they won The Battle of Winterfell and killed The Night King, in all its shocking glory. After seeing Hardhome so many times, I thought there was no way it would be anyone else but Jon to kill him, but the Arya twist was welcomed to me. Especially since they've pretty much been setting it up for awhile now. Arya sneaking up on Jon and getting the dagger she used (Catspaw) right in front of the tree, as well as her conversation with Melisandre all the way back in season 3, all leading to the moment where she did that bada** knife move.The battle itself was nothing short of remarkable. Much like in The Battle of the Bastards, Sapochnik wants you to feel like you're in the heart of the battlefield. Whether it's seeing The Unsullied getting smothered by waves of walkers, the winter storm that blinds the dragon's sight, the oner's on the ground following several characters, or even Arya's haunted house moment, this was excellently shot. And yes, I'm acknowledging that those first 20 minutes were on the harder side to actually see what was going on. But that was entirely on purpose.The fallen included Beric, Ed, Melisandre, Lyanna, Jorah, and Theon. All important characters in their own right, but the big ones were really Jorah and Theon. Both going out protecting the people they love and in beautifully tragic fashion. My heart breaks for Jorah who will never get to see Dany on the throne and Theon who finally got the acknowledgement of Bran that he was a good man. Yes, I certainly expected there to be even more deaths, but if you have too many, then it loses its impact.There's so much more I could dig into, like the Sansa & Tyrion stuff, Jon charging The Night King, Grey Worm's survival, and all that Dragon on Dragon fight, but my overall thoughts were that I really enjoyed how this episode was handled. I legitimately can't remember the last episode of television that had me jumping up and down and yelling at the screen. But that's Thrones for ya.10/10",

No further spoiler - but it closed in my opinion on one of the biggest question. And the most intriguing plot line for me to be honest as well. The episode was pretty spectacular, but only if you could see what was even happening on the screen because of terrible lighting design - i do understand that by shooting in a nighttime (seemingly), creators saves a lot of costs on special effects (this is an old as the movies goes thing), but still i couldn't fuxxxxing see a damn thing during first like ~30 min. Later it was better because of mostly interior sets.Overall, i did enjoying this episode very much despite so very dark cinematography. It closed one huge chapter of the story and wanted to see me how it all end. Great episode all in all.",

They did a great job from the opening scene. Keeping you feeling on the edge from the music score and it's claustrophobic dark camera shots. Yes, i will admit the episode and battle was a little difficult to see from the lack of lighting. But it was still a fantastic and intense episode. The longest battle ever shot on film beating out the lord of the rings two towers. It is also one of those episodes were it will get emotional with characters you know for a long time. Meeting there end. Plus the aerial dog fight with daenarys and jon snow riding there dragons facing against the night king and his undead dragon was just awesome. There are some surprises with characters and there actions.Overall, this episode was the one you have been waiting for. It does leave you wanting more with the battle of the undead. Now it is time to see what the remaining of the season has in store.",

This episode is much longer.I love that this episode doesn't get right into the battle, there is a buildup. Armies are put into position, It's more like a game of chess. What is the night king going to do? How is he going to attack?The Dothraki Are like pawns on this board, placed out in front. It does not seem like it went well for them. Ironically it was \"the red woman\" that gave the Dothraki some protection, and protection for Winterfell. When I first saw her character in the first episode of season two, I despised her. But she evolved into into the great tragic figure of the show. She realizes the harm and damage she has done, and this is the best she can do to make amends. It is not a lot but it is enough.But the irony here is when I realized that Daenerys had named her dragons for three influential men: Kahl Diogo, and her brothers Viserys and Rhaegar.Guess which dragons Jon Snow and the Night King are riding?So it turns out that the namesake of Viserys returns from his golden crowning to wreak revenge on his sister.While Jon rides the dragon named after his own father...I haven't seen this episode since it aired. I loved it then, I still love it. But it was upon watching it for the first time in a long time last night I realized the relationship between the names of the dragons and their respective riders. I thought that was a nice touch, very appropriate.The music is probably the best music ever written for the series, especially at the very end where it starts with a few piano notes and builds into a beautiful fugue.It is difficult to watch this episode during the daytime, you can't have one speck of light in the room otherwise it spoils the effect.Nevertheless, it's probably the most powerful episode of the entire series. And I respect the work that went into making it happen, which was on par with filming the Helms Deep battle in lord of the rings.",

This was still a good episode but not epic and certainly not full of twists that has made GoT what it is. I found it difficult to keep track of what was going on, it seemed the White Walkers were moving just too fast to observe anything. When Ser Davos waved his torches in the air for Jon and Danny and yelled they can't see us I yelled to the screen 'Neither can we'. Despite claims of realism it fails to recognize a basic rule that the audience must be able to see the whole thing. There were some mesmerizing scenes and good moments but this episode left too many questions. How did Arya get past the generals, why was the Night King so drawn to Bran?The end to one of the greatest and mysterious villains was also a huge anticlimax. To be taken down in one episode after 8 seasons of build up and in a somewhat dull fashion. Also most of our main characters were too protected as usual. GoT is a show where when you make mistakes you die. Sam, Jaimie, and Ser Brienne all were safe despite Wights surrounding them. People have said that not everyone would be pleased with the battle. But the difference with GoT is we have seen them execute epic battles such as Hardhome and the Battle of the Bastards. It can be done. A different style and artistic choices were made that led to a lackluster episode. I am really hoping they nail the final 3 episodes.",

                    "content": "I have not commented on this show since I stopped enjoying it a few years ago, although I love the source material and the first three seasons. I'll break my silence now because this episode represents everything Game of Thrones has become since season 5: magnificent visuals and production values, splendid soundtrack, excellent performances (even Harington and Clarke, who were a bit shaky in the first couple of seasons, have grown solid), some effective moments (Theon's last stand, for example, is legitimately moving)... and disappointing writing.Martin's books are not Crime and Punishment but at least he can write coherent characters and themes; the show, on the other hand, ignores themes (it got Martin's romanticism exactly wrong, turning it into garden-variety nihilism), keeps pushing the reset button on character arcs (see Jaime after season 3) and gleefully ignores any logic that gets in the way of the desired outcome (the absurd Sansa-Bolton marriage, Dany's hilariously suicidal campaign against Cersei, the grotesque \"wight hunt\"...).With this episode, the whole point of the series - selfish people waste time and lives in petty dynastic wars while the apocalypse is coming - falls apart. Cersei becomes the ultimate villain to defeat; the Night King (a bad guy manufactured by the show to be the \"face\" of the White Walkers) goes down like a wimp halfway through the last season.And is killed by Arya. Don't get me wrong, I love Arya. Well, LOVED her in the first seasons, as she has become increasingly smug in the last years.But why Arya? She has no connection to the Night King and the White Walkers plot. The three meaningful choices were Jon (involved in the Wall storyline since season one), Bran (whose subplot has the stronger ties to the supernatural) or Dany (as a foil to the Night King, the \"fire\" to his \"ice\", the good dragon rider versus the evil one, the messianic figure versus the diabolic one). All the build-up about prophecies becomes pointless gibberish now.Arya killing the Night King is like Han Solo killing the Emperor; like Legolas riding to Mount Doom and destroying the One Ring; like Ron Weasley defeating Voldemort; like Hicks confronting the Alien Queen. It's pleasing in a \"Yay, a character we like kills the bad guy!\" way, but it doesn't go beyond that. It's shallow, empty, meaningless. There needs to be a deeper connection between the villain and the hero who defeats him.Well, Arya was chosen for two reasons. One, because of fanservice, as she is loved by both fans and writers. Two, to subvert expectations.Let me get this straight about \"subverting expectations\" (see also The Last Jedi). Any hack can \"subvert expectations\". Just throw in stuff that comes out of nowhere (Varys kills the Night King! Euron joins the good guys!). What's difficult is doing it in a MEANINGFUL way which, in retrospect, makes sense in terms of plots, characterization, themes.The Red Wedding was a brilliant subversion of expectations: everyone was expecting Robb to avenge Ned but he was betrayed and killed. Still, looking back at his storyline, all the signs were there; it was the tragic but somewhat logic outcome of his mistakes and misfortunes.\"Subverting expectations\" just because you can is typical of schlock. If the books will ever come out, I am certain that, for better or for worse, the Others / White Walkers plotline will have a completely different outcome (and Cersei will be toast well before the Long Night).Now I wonder how the good guys will dispose of Cersei. *She* would have been the perfect target for Arya: a political villain defeated by an assassin, just like a supernatural villain should be defeated by a magical character (*cough* Bran *cough*).Maybe now they'll go full circle and have Jon or Bran kill Cersei. You know, to subvert expectations.",

                    "content": "Have always absolutely loved 'Game of Thrones'. When it was at its best, it kept me glued, although it was a gradual binge watch with so much going on, and was seriously addictive. The best episodes were as brilliant as television can get. It did justice to the equally brilliant source material, wholly deserving to be adapted, and mostly stays true to it despite the odd controversial moment/scene.This mainly applies to Seasons 1-5, while Season 7 was uneven with only two great episodes (\"The Spoils of War\" being the best) while boasting two of 'Game of Thrones' worst episodes. So far Season 8 has had a fair share of truly impressive elements, but have not been blown away as an overall whole and by 'Game of Thrones' stands it has been a disappointment. Only \"The Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" reached great standards, \"Winterfell\" was uneven but still good and \"The Long Night\" understandably was heavily controversial on both sides (had big problems with it while recognising its big efforts and it is not an episode to forget in a hurry). It has so far been a divisive season understandably with strong opinions on both sides for all the episodes, especially \"The Long Night\" when and after it aired. Fit in neither love or hate category just to say as indicated already.Watching \"The Last of the Starks\", the last two episodes of the show will really need to step up their game big time because although it did have a fair share of good points this is one of the few 'Game of Thrones' episodes where from my perspective the hate has been completely understandable. Am someone who did genuinely watch it on NowTV with my sisters, also fans, the night after it aired, rather than being one of those who rated it low or rated it high to counter the low ratings before the episode aired, which is immature behaviour and over the top again from personal opinion. Needed time to gather my thoughts and make every effort to be fair. As of now, \"The Last of the Starks\" is the lowest rated episode here and also the most hated episode, \"The Long Night\" also got a huge amount of hate but it was more controversial than near-completely panned. As for me, did not think the episode was that bad, there are good points that are enough to give it at least a 3 and am not sure as to whether it is the very worst episode. But there are a lot of flaws here and sadly they are not small, it is definitely one of my least favourite 'Game of Thrones' episodes (bottom 5) and have seldom been this disappointed/conflicted in an episode of a show that at its best is one of the best there is in a long time.Good things are here in \"The Last of the Starks\". Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done. As well the cinematography and editing, which are cinematic quality as well, while the special effects, while not the very best of the show, put many recent shows and films to shame. The dragons are extremely well rendered here. One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The opening credits are beautifully designed.A few good scenes, though too far and between. The opening scene was very emotional to me and beautifully staged and shot, to me Emilia Clarke was very moving and expressive in this scene. The ending had a tense build up and shocked me to the core and brought tears to my eyes. Some occasional nice banter, political intrigue and character interaction reasonably early on that felt like 'Game of Thrones'. The acting as always is strong, it is very hard to be disappointed in Peter Dinklage for example and Lena Headey makes much of her short screen time. There is the right amount of broodiness and expressiveness from all, Clarke giving her best performance of the season so far.However, there is also a lot wrong in \"The Last of the Starks\". For one, the pacing was very spotty here. There are too many dead spots that drag early on, while towards and at the end the episode felt rushed and like it was trying to pack a lot in with little time to breathe. The script was also messy, there are intriguing moments (Jon Snow's speech being the best written scene by default) but some of the writing really made me cringe at its cheesiness and near-immaturity and turn round to my sisters in disbelief, like for example the writing for Brienne in one of the episode's most awkward scenes that was an insult really to 'Game of Thrones'. The story lacked tension and suffered primarily from feeling like two or three episodes packed into one, while there was a lot of draggy pacing the episode felt bloated and like the writers had run out of material too.In terms of character and story progression, that was a very mixed bag. There is signs of story progression, but that came too late into the episode and should have been more interesting. Character progression though was not there, if anything rather than advancing it went backwards and saw characters behaving out of character and behaving nonsensical decisions. Also found Jon Snow incredibly dull, other than his speech. Many others have mentioned the dragon ambush, completely share their opinions of it being intelligence-insultingly ridiculous and it not making sense in any shape or form, also found it rushed as well. Other than the heavily problematic pacing, writing and storytelling, another huge problem is the emotional emptiness. A vast majority of 'Game of Thrones' episodes had tension, poignancy, thrills, fun and thought-probing. Other than two scenes, got very little of any of those here.Summarising, a disappointment in too many respects while having its moments. It underwhelms as an episode for anything but by 'Game of Thrones' standards, which is usually very good to exceptionally high, this doesn't cut it. A perhaps generous 5/10",

I'm one of the seemingly few people who enjoyed Daenerys and her slide into madness, so all of the plotting between her and Jon and the advisers made perfect sense to me. Sure, the death of her second dragon is handled in a ridiculous way, and there's THAT sub-plot between Jaime and Brienne which never should have been explored. Plus there's Bronn speed-talking his way through a rushed scene which comes across as nonsensical. Apart from these moments, the rest is focused, momentous, and an able set-up for the next instalment.",

What are IMDB reviews worth if a huge number of them were written before the episode was released. I'm hoping that this can be sorted out. It's this childish stuff that ruins the whole idea behind User Reviews. Most of the ones I read had nothing specific to say other than to make personal comments about each other. This does progress the story and we are shown the power of the enemy. We see the dignity of those who wish to have a peaceful outcome.

All becomes a sort of embroidery of secrets, dark betrayels, noble hand of the queen, fake tension, because you feel the end and the feeling is not the best and all seems a too long prepaire of the last punch. Sure, a nice show, childish story in few seasons and interesting characters. But the characters become so fragile than all seems the fall of a too long party. The death of a dragon, the death of Missandei , the words of Lord Varys, the cold sigh of Sansa, in other season are precious pieces. Now - only details. I admit, I am far to be a fan of GoT. But the so great, almost legendary serie becomes a sort of chain of compromises and the conclusion, in bizarre way , is simple - none deserves the Iron Throne. Except Samwell , who has better duty, Lord Varys who only serves the interests of kingdom, Sandor Clengane who has his duty too or the charming Lord Gendry. Or, the best solution, Ser Brienne. An episode like the taste of coffe matter. But, after seven seasons, it is a not significant detail.The virtues - the fine portrait of loneliness of Daennerys and the effort to transform her in the Mad Queen. Different options, memories about steps of the long way to the battle of Winterfell . And vulnerabilities. Nice work but its purpose seems not be so noble. And that is the only significant detail.So, Dracarys !",

Daenerys, her dragons and her fleet stumble upon Euron\u00b4s fleet and are defeated and Missandei is captured by the enemy. Daenerys decides to go to King\u00b4s Landing to ask Cersei to surrender but she takes a tragic decision.\"The Last of the Starks\" is another excellent episode of \"Game of Thrones\" with the aftermath of the Battle of Winterfell. There are bad decisions mainly from Jon Snow, disclosing his secret to his sisters, and from Daenerys, deciding to attack Dragonstone and King\u00b4s Landing with a wounded dragon and a weak and exhausted army. Sansa has become a disappointing character. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): \"The Last of the Starks\"",

Jon's popularity is bothering Daenerys, especially now she knows that he has a valid claim to the Iron Throne... even if he assures her that he has no desire to be king. With the funerals and then the celebrations over protagonists discuss what to do next; many advise caution but Daenerys is determined that they will head south as soon as possible. En route to King's Landing her forces are ambushed and suffer a defeat to Euron Greyjoy's fleet during which one of the people closest to Daenerys is captured. Ultimately her forces arrive at King's Landing... Tyrion wants to find a peaceful solution but will Daenerys or Cersei want to listen?Perhaps, having heard others' comments, it is because I was prepared for a really bad episode I ended up being pleasantly surprised. It started well with a funeral for those who died in the battle followed by the celebrations. These proved to be entertaining, with much drinking and joviality tempered by Daenerys's obvious annoyance that everybody seems to be praised except for her. Tensions then rise nicely; particularly between Sansa and Daenerys. When the move south begins the ambush comes as a real surprise and will clearly have major repercussions in the series final two episodes. There are some weak points; people seem to travel across Westeros much more quickly; journeys that took half a series in earlier times now take less than half an episode with no real indication of time passing and I've lost count of how many times Tyrion has been nearly killed in battle only to survive! The battle scene may have been short but it was certainly exciting and set things up for the episodes shocking ending. Overall I certainly enjoyed this more than most... maybe because I went in expecting worse; maybe I'm easily pleased or maybe it is actually a decent episode.",

For all the people last week complaining about The Great War being over and that Game of Thrones was making the wrong decision about the real big bad of the show, this episode did a whole lot to swing the tide. Much like last week, my legs were shaking with angst and stomach constantly turning, waiting for the inevitable to happen. Waiting for characters I love to die. RIP Missandei and Rhaegal. Dany's team gets smaller and smaller as the weeks pass.Dave and Dan (showrunners) are right, Dany is now at a similar point in her life to how she was at the start of the show, alone. And as Maester Aemon once said \"A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing\". That makes me really worried for her, although technically Jon is one too, but we all know where that situation stands.I really loved the first 20 minutes or so, mourning the dead but also celebrating the fact that they actually won the great war. Tormund was his usual self, Gendry was proclaimed Lord of Storm's End, and even Tyrion got Jaime, Pod, and Brienne to play his drinking game. But the real thing of note here is how Dany feels during all of this. Everyone is getting praise and celebrating with their friends and loved ones while Dany sits alone and watches as her claim gets diminished in the process. I know we've all been hard on her the past few seasons, but I really felt bad for her tonight. Think about all she's gone through and lost, just within the last few episodes. She's the definition of a loner.After Jon went against Daenerys' desire and told his family about his true heritage (which admittedly I really wanted to see on screen), the truth inevitably found its way to Tyrion and Varys. The latter of which I could of sworn was going to die this week. The truth about Jon gave those two a few scenes in which we're meant to believe they will eventually betray Dany to support Jon's claim, which of course means nothing because he simply doesn't want it. Even in this episode I keep flipping back and forth as to who I believe will die between Dany & Jon, or even both at this point.I should probably mention just how nice it was to finally see Brienne and Jaime acknowledge their love for one another, even if the former surely loves him way more than he cares for her, which makes it even more devastating when Jaime decides to leave her at Winterfell and head south. I tend to believe he's going back to try and stop Cersei and fingers crossed kill her, but the scene could be interpreted multiple ways.A few other goodbyes seem to indicate that Jon will never return North, he says goodbye to Sam, Tormund and even Ghost. That broke my heart, but at least Ghost is still breathing, I was a little worried after last week.The only problem I had with the episode was that it didn't handle Danerys' arrival to King's landing all that well. So we're just going to ride the Dragons right up to the coast and risk getting them taken out, which Rhaegal did? Logistically it didn't seem to make much sense, though i guess at her emotional level, she may make some irrational decisions, much like Jon does when his emotions get the better of him. It was also a weird choice for her to walk that close to the walls of King's Landing with her *very small* Unsullied army and expect anything good to happen. But that final sequence was marvelous nevertheless.A few other tidbits worth mentioning:-The Hound and Arya back together again-That Bronn scene actually had me very nervous-Jon saying the dead heroes were the shield that guarded the realms of men was a nice addition-Gilly and Sam naming their kid Jon was heartwarming10/10",

And what a great TV it is (still!). Amazing production design, great acting, very solid directing and writing..., well writing isn't this shows strong point anymore, unfortunately. I do agree that this show started to be more and more predictable starting season 5, and first 4 seasons, well, no one will probably ever top first 4 season of this show but hey - if you are one of the few people still left on this planet at this point who can simply enjoy a still great show for what it is, and not for what it must have been in everyone head and imagination - you will be entertained watching this episode, as every single before. Because the story itself can't be more epic, production values are as great as they can be and a craftsmanship of this show itself is superb, still, as usual. So stop hating, and enjoy for what it is - a really good entertainment.",

The ship battle was really cool Tyrian was lucky to make it out. Unfortunately a dragon didn't make it and it is strange Daenerys didn't see it coming though, and even kinda ironic that a friend on PS4 just hours beforehand, predicted that a dragon would die. Lastly I thought it had an enticing epilogue!",

In other words, both Queens die terribly. The dragon as well. Jon lives, then there are sequels. Argh. Spare me this trash. I should note, Cersei has the best sneer on the show. Also, Lena Headey is the best actress on the show. Liam Cunningham has been in many more films than all of tgese people. He is underused, & a terrific actor. I liked him in a slew of films. Those 2 are the best actors: Lena & Liam. Peter Dinklage is quite good, but Stephen Dillane (was) easily the top actor. He was terrific with Clemence Poesy in \"The Tunnel\"; a 3 season series based on a Swedish book and show. Like \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\" (the original Swedish film. It made an international star of Swedish/Icelandic actress Noomi Rapace; also the lead in Ridley Scott's \"Prometheus\" (2012), his prequel to \"Alien\" (1979); 1 of the 2 most terrifying films I have ever seen when they came out. The other was William Friedkin's \"The Exorcist\" (1973). Both were groundbreaking films made long before CGI. They hand built everything. Incredible special effects especially because there were no computers (no CGI). So long folks. The sooner this overbloated series is over, the better.",

It's not particularly awful or anything, but it could've been so much better.The writing is bland and lacks the spark of the previous episodes (I know many people hated Season 5 and 7 but at least they had more momentum), the characters that used to be interesting and complex have now been reduced to one-dimensional, the pacing drags on for way too long, and the overall dialogue isn't quite as strong.However, there are still some good things in the episode. The cinematography and costumes continue to be well made and impressive, there are one or two moments that were heartfelt (which I won't spoil to those who haven't seen the episode), the music score from Ramin Djawadi is still beautiful and compliments the atmosphere, and the acting, despite the bland writing and dialogue, is still good at least with Peter Dinklage, Kit Harrington, and Emilia Clarke doing their best.Overall, The Last of the Starks had potential but exactly ended up bland to me.

                    "content": "When 'Game of Thrones' was at its best, it made for utterly riveting television and was the best television could possibly get. Very easy to get into, even though it did take me a while to get through the episodes with a lot going on and the watch and review list increasing all the time and now gradually decreasing, and one of the most addictive shows ever from personal opinion. This is especially true for the best of Seasons 1-5 and there were shining moments too in Season 6. Season 7 was uneven, with only two great episodes to me.Am going to agree with those that have said that Season 8 has been disappointing. It started off quite well, though \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" was the only one to reach great standard while not being top-tier 'Game of Thrones'. \"The Long Night\" was by 'Game of Thrones' standards disappointing and the controversy is understandable, but still really appreciated the huge effort that was put into it and it is not an episode to forget. What was a major disappointment was \"The Last of the Starks\", which has been panned by a lot of fans and it is not hard at all to see why. Did say in my review for that episode that the last two episodes would need to step up big time. Something that \"The Bells\" did not do, didn't think it was that bad to warrant a lot of one star votes, some before the episode was aired, but it in my mind is not deserving of the 10/10s which seem to have been awarded for knee jerk reactions rather than merit. Also, can those who have given the episode 7 and above please actually write proper reviews for the episode and not be so immature and insulting to those who didn't like the episode in comments that read more like rants.\"The Bells\" flaws do outweigh the cons by quite some way, like \"The Last of the Starks\" this is one of the two of the worst 'Game of Thrones' episodes (except this is worse, as that episode had a little more emotion and didn't have as many character inconsistencies) and doesn't do the show justice in any way. One of those examples of an episode that has completely lost what made its respective show so great in the first place, and that is just shameful. It is also like that episode one of the few where the hate is completely understandable and for valid from personal perspective reasons. And this is coming from someone who genuinely did see it earlier this week, and my siblings who are also 'Game of Thrones' fans expressed even more intense dislike than me. After this and the previous episode, hopes for the final episode are not high and am not sure as to how the show is going to pull off a final episode when \"The Bells\" itself felt like a show finale in its second half that was heavily problematic and the actual final episode may feel one episode too long. It would have actually been better that the first portion of the episode at Dragonstone was an episode of build up, namely for Daenerys, and all the events at Kings Landing being the final episode, and that would have solved the two or more episodes in one feel that the episode had.Lets start with what \"The Bells\" did well, as there are good things here that are enough for the episode to warrant a 2 at least. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. One of the best looking episodes of the entire show actually, with some truly mind-blowing and cinematic-esque photography that was so immersive throughout. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done, while the special effects, while not the very best of the show, put many recent shows and films to shame. The dragon is extremely well rendered here.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The opening credits are beautifully designed. There are great moments here, the best being with Jaime and Tyrion, Sandor and Arya (both heartfelt) and a little tension in the Sandor/Gregor duel. The acting is very good considering the material, with Lena Headey, Nikolaj Coster-Waldau and Emilia Clarke coming off best. Peter Dinklage also does his best, despite his material being beneath him.Sadly, there is so much wrong with \"The Bells\". It has a lot of the same flaws \"The Last of the Starks\" had, except executing them worse, and also having more problems. Everything felt very rushed and like 2 episodes at least in one, with little breathing space and a lot of the latter half of the episode came over as very muddled in what was happening. There are not as many dead spots as the previous episode, but too much is packed in but at the same time one can really tell that the show had run out of ideas and material as moments do feel like padding. The script is also an absolute mess, there is no intrigue and much of it is childish and forced, the cringe factor was high here. \"The Bells\" should have been an episode with the most tension and emotion of the series, both came in spades but unfortunately was distracted by the insulting lack of logic, the complete lack of sense, nonsensical character motivations, pointless moments, deux ex machinas, coincidences and inconsistencies that are too numerous to list and have been summed up already by others.Found the ending to be too much of an anti-climax, leaving more questions than answers and doing an injustice to such great characters. Just to say, was not expecting a happy ending, that actually would have jarred and been too pat and many others would feel the same. This would have been the right way to end actually, but it was a case of the right ending being executed wrongly which is what people mean when criticising the ending. Saw no point in the overlong and truly ridiculous to the point of unintentional silliness scene between Jaime and Euron, and Euron here and in the previous episode was a waste of time as a character, one with no real threat and was rather cheesy instead, that could easily have been left out of the episode and nobody would miss him. The layered and complex characterisation and development is cast to the wind here, there is no character progression other than with the often spoken about Daenerys which was as others have said handled badly. If anything the character development has gone backwards in Season 8, not only are the characters cliched and pale shadows of their former selves behaving nonsensically or for little reason they are out of character and this was apparent from the very beginning of the episode. Too many have too little to do as well, Jon Snow is especially now a complex blank.Regarding Daenerys, there was foreshadowing definitely throughout the show of how she would become the way she was here, which those that disliked the episode have not disputed. As they have not disputed that it was brought on by grief and hatred. But still the build up to the descent in the episode felt very rushed and another episode would have helped make it more gradual, and her actual actions were extreme in my view. Can understand taking revenge on Cersei and those who supported her, but not when it came to taking it out on entirely innocent people. That was not the signs of a conflicted and complex character who had lost everything, and instead one turned with little build up into a one-dimensional villain introduced in a way that made no sense. That's what people are getting at when considering what was done to Daenerys in the writing as a character assassination, in an episode full of them.Altogether, hugely disappointing and instead of having high anticipations expectations for the final episode are now very low. 4/10",

Miguel Sapochnik's direction really blows this out of the water and the second half of the episode really lets loose in a fierce, explosive and completely destructive way that far surpasses even the likes of THE LONG NIGHT. I had no problem with the ways the characters acted at all, as it all makes perfect sense to me. There are crowd-pleasing moments like the long-awaited 'Cleganebowl', Arya suddenly snapping back and becoming the lovable character she was for the first six seasons, and an ending for Jaime and Cersei that I initially hated but have grown to love. The extensive and endless CGI effects are quite brilliant - and I say that as somebody who's no fan of computer graphics in general - and the sense of epic destruction quite breathtaking. A true climax for the show.",

This was a non-stop action piece. The problem was that so much went on, there was little cinematic focus. We had no sense of where people were and what they were involved in. There were some titanic battles (mostly for their own sake) but at times I wondered where is the rest of the regular cast. Anyway, I suppose the final episode will answer some questions. By the way, you naysayers have every right to give a \"one\" to these shows, but why don't you just watch something else?",

Not the happy end is expected but some logic and respect for characters, actors and public. Because this episode becomes a sort of Fahrenheit 451 or Nero Rome in flames.

Our frustrations, our desilusions, our hard work who could be transformed in tool by others is so rare ? So exotic or eccentric ?Sure, it is easy - the episode 5 is awfull. Cersei deserves a better death, Lord Varys deserves a noble end. But the \"Dracarys *\" of the end of episode 4 was an ilusion ? No ! It was the resume, the seed of this simple, dramatic, boring - maybe- , for a part of public. A blasphemy for others. But a decent job. Because it is not about a Mad Queen. It is just about us. We, the viewers who, in so many occasions are looking for the perfect dragon for the most powerful, convincing, out of mercy, revenge.Season 8 has many sins .

The fight of Jaime and Euron is boring and too long. The end of Cersei is also disappointing. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): \"The Bells\"",

She considers those who don't do what she says to be betraying her... that includes Jon for telling his sisters about his real parentage. There are two possibilities of averting a massacre; Jaime will persuade Cersei to flee the city and live in exile with him or Arya will get to her and kill her before the assault begins. Neither seem that likely and it is of no surprise that the battle is not averted. Soon the battle turns into a rout and then a brutal massacre.This was a genuinely shocking episode; there have been many times when bad people have done terrible things and times when good characters do bad things but here one who always claimed to be seeking justice committing an act that makes the hated Joffrey seem like a bleeding heart liberal! I can see how this would disappoint some viewers but for me it was 'Game of Thrones' at its most 'Game of Thrones'. It isn't just one character that does bad things; once the attack begins many of the 'liberating' forces run amok killing surrendering soldiers and civilians alike. While there is fire raining down on the city and pitched battles taking place there are also times for individual battles as Jamie faces Euron and Sandor Clagane and his long-hated brother. There were a few weak points; most notably how Arya nearly died so many times. As always the acting was great and the special effects top notch. Overall I really enjoyed the episode and can't wait to see how the series ends.",

Yes, the writing and plot development seems rushed compared to previous seasons. I think I understand where you are coming from because I was a long time fan of Buffy The Vampire Slayer only to watch it go off a cliff in seasons six and seven. From great character development and dialogue that rolls trippingly off the tongue to flat dialogue, sudden developments that come out of nowhere and a final big bad that seemed neither. All because Joss Whedon wanted to go off and write a space western that was cancelled after 13 episodes. But I digress.Looking at previous episodes of GOT, I think I know where you are coming from. It is not that the dialogue is bad it is just not present like it was in past seasons. That being said \"The Bells\" was visually stunning if heart breaking. And stop looking for \"the reason\" for Dany burning King's Landing to the ground with her one remaining dragon - who apparently does not need time to refuel. Loss of advisors, betrayal by the ones who remain, personal losses, and the madness that was probably always genetically embedded in her have turned her into the \"Mad Queen\". Just how mad is symbolized by the occasional puffs of green fire that ignite through the city, the wildfire planted by her father \"The Mad King\", seemingly impotent next to the destruction of Drogon's breath.Then there was just one big \"Huh??\" moment for me. Arya, intent on getting revenge, accepting that she will not come back from that revenge for ages and will pay with her life, is given exactly two lines of admonition from the Hound to forget about revenge and live, and she just says \"Okay!\", oh, and \"Thank you!\".We did need her view of the carnage on the ground, but the set up for her change of heart just was not there. So it must be a disappointment to see your brilliant TV show become just above average, because I've been there before. But that doesn't mean I'm not watching the last episode.",

Unlike Arya to be dissuade merely by the words \"do you want to end up like me?\" Just to have a main character from within. I like the two titans fighting on the steps. The Mountain just won't die, so The Hound decides to rid the world of the both of them. Cersei's death wasn't really a worthy exit, she should of been eaten or killed by a random peasant. Will Arya let those innocent lives taken go unpunished... we will see.The Hound, Cersei, The Mountain and Tyrion the standouts.",

In a way, fulfilling Dany's dream sequence from season 2 at the House of the Undying, Dany will now walk into the Throne Room (not covered in snow, but rather, ash) after nearly the entire city of King's Landing gets burnt to the ground and thousands of civilians burnt to the crisp.Much like the best battles this show has ever done, it rarely goes the way you think. Wildfire, The Vale appearing, Dany saving them beyond the wall, or Arya's last second strike, I was on the edge of my seat the entire night, and that goes to show you just how impeccable this episode is directed. We got Cleganebowl and Jaime dying in the arms of Cersei, both things fans wanted to see, and this is all amidst the destruction of King's Landing with Arya's trek through the streets.In the words of the horrible Ramsay Bolton in season 3 \"If you think this has a happy ending, you haven't been paying attention\".So what is that ending now? We have one episode left and half the main cast is gone. Does it come down to Jon fulfilling the Prince Who Was Promised prophecy (in a roundabout way) and kill Dany, with a sword through her heart? Like I was saying a few weeks back, does the power leave King's Landing now that it's in ash and go to the North? Does Jon ultimately sit on whatever's left of 'The Throne'? I would bet money he leaves it all behind and goes North, but who knows. That's why we love this show.10/10",

Many, many plots have came to an end here, and i loved every single one of them. And how surprisingly it turn out to be - for me personally, who does not theorize everything and just enjoys this show for what it is. Visuals of this episode were outstanding to say the least and direction was superb.Overall, i highly enjoyed \"The Bells\" - one of the very best episodes of this show. Amazingly staged, emotional and brutal - this is the highlight of this season. Can't wait for last episode.",

Enough said about the plot without spoilers which they have done a great job in keeping this one a secret. I have loved how every character development and story has reached up to here. Characters are tested, reached their potential for making the better choices. When it comes to this final battle. The episode was intense and spectacular. The battle sequence was great. And it does not stop there. There are a couple of surprises and twists and turns which gets very dark. That will leave you feeling a little haunted from this episode. Sure, some complained about The Long Night battle for being too dark. Well this one takes place during the day. And it leaves you on the edge.Overall, this episode is one of the best in the season so far. And it is chaotic, crazy, insane, and it does get emotional with characters. The battle was intense and the fight sequences with characters are just fantastic. It ends with you feeling haunted and speechless and really excited to see how the last episode will end.",

You were shocked when you saw the red wedding or the origins of Hodor but you could trace it back to its origins. I'm not going to be extreme and have a huge go at this show because the truth is I'm saddened by its current path. Now we have characters being forced to fit within a plot, character development tossed aside as if it meant nothing.The story arc for Dany becoming the mad queen was not only forced it was illogical. Dany has been suffering her whole life and come out stronger, hard to believe a few recent bad turns would turn her mad. Lets also not forgot how the Night King and White Walker story line still remains the biggest missed opportunity. It was also anticlimatic to see Cersei die the way she did after all she's done. Shock value can only carry you so much. When season 8 started I said how are they going to wrap up this universe in 6 episodes. Now I'm thinking what's left?Drogon is a metaphor in a way. The city and buildings that he took down so fast without thinking can be how the show runners have mindlessly torn down years of character development, potential and fan goodwill.",

Euron survives again to be engaged in a lame battle with Jamie? Seems like the writers are rushing to finish. I hope they don't do the same thing with Star Wars. Dany deserves to die in the next episode. And I expect Tyrion will no longer want to serve her, which will get him killed. Hopefully Arya will cut her throat, leaving Jon - who by virtue of not wanting to rule - will be a better ruler. The best part of this was Sandor Clegane getting closure by killing his brother (one of the dumber ideas in the book and movie), and his brother crushing Qyburn's head. Over all, most of the main cast is dead and rather than looking forward to this season ending, I'm glad it is. Oh, and I'm still pissed that Jon couldn't take two seconds to say goodbye to Ghost. Screw Dragons, Dogs are man's best friend and Ghost proved it time and again.",

If you have watched it from the beginning you would know that even though Daenerys could be as ruthless as her enemies, her actions were just and out of revenge. There is no way you can create a character over many episodes and this is the pay off. It makes absolutely no sense. Kill the soldiers and head to the tower. It's that simple. You don't kill thousands of innocents for no reason. Especially Daenerys. I understand GOT has many plot twists but was really the wrong move. If Daenerys was killed in her quest for the throne you would accept it because this is the show. You will never accept her death because Daenerys would never have done this. Not only has it ruined the season it's ruined the complete series as you will not want to rewatch it knowing how it will all end. It really is a shame as other scenes such as The Hound and The Mointain's fight were excellent. You probably know what happens in last episode and this makes matters worse. I was going to buy the complete series when it has finished but unfortunately now I feel like it has been ruined and it's disheartening.",

Certainly not everybody.But I can confidently say that this episode shook me and got me even feeling emotional for the first time since maybe season 6's final episode, and a lot of it reminded me of why I liked Game Of Thrones in the first place.Technically this episode is masterful, and far more coherent and well-filmed than the now somewhat infamous episode 3 of this season. Plus, there were certainly more casualties and a whole lot less plot armour.There are things here I've wanted to see happen for years and years, and honestly, while I won't argue that this is perfect or even one of the show's best episodes, I think some people are being far too harsh on The Bells (and this is coming from somebody who agrees with many of the criticisms piled on the last few episodes).Go in with an open mind and let the show do its thing. Some of the scenes here are truly spectacular, and I think this particular episode deserves a little more credit, because it made me feel things I haven't felt Game Of Thrones give me in ages.",

Season 6 wasn't as consistently good to outstanding but still had a lot of great elements, while Season 7 was more uneven, with two great episodes and also two of the weakest episodes of the show.Not as much though as the worst of Season 8, which to me actually started off solidly, with \"A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms\" being the season high point, but from the climax of \"The Long Night\" (a heavily flawed episode but did appreciate the effort that went into it on namely a scope level) onwards it became one big disappointment. With it getting worse with each episode when it became more rushed, increasingly ran out of ideas, the writing worsened to the point that by \"The Last of the Starks\" it was a complete and utter indefensible mess and more characters were assassinated in terms of writing. Only the production values, music and acting remained good or more, as well as the odd memorable scenes or character moments. When you compare it to when the show first started and now, it is hard to believe that the slap in the face that is the season and show finale, by far the show's worst episode and worst show finales for any show, \"The Iron Throne\" came from the same show. One of the few episodes, the only perhaps, where my sisters, brother and me were all in agreement over our thoughts on a 'Game of Thrones' episode, resulting in an over-an-hour phone conversation sounding off all its flaws which was actually more entertaining and fulfilling.And no condescending defenders, whose \"comments\" mostly read more like rants attacking/insulting those that disliked the episode rather than any kind of review saying what was good about it, while those that disliked it mostly actually gave valid reasons for doing so, we were not trying to hate it from the very start with the season being so overall disappointing. Do think that it is not quite as bad as to warrant 1/10s, which is a bit disrespectful to the production team and actors' hard work, though and the negative reaction has been on the extreme side, to me there were a few great things about it, but the disappointment is completely understandable. We were not expecting a Disney-like happy ending, we wanted an ending and final episode that had good writing, made us connect to the drama emotionally, properly tie things up, show a return to form in quality and show signs of remembering what made the show so great in the first place and did justice to such great characters and their arcs. \"The Iron Throne\" did not do that in any shape or form and failed to do all those things. It was clear that it had completely lost sight of what made the best of 'Game of Thrones' as great as it was, and too many questions begging to be answered were not fully answered and more questions were raised instead.Lets start with the few good things \"The Iron Throne\" had. Visually, it looks amazing, as one would expect for 'Game of Thrones'. With some truly mind-blowing and cinematic-esque photography that was so immersive throughout. The scenery is throughout spectacular, the sets are hugely atmospheric and beautiful on the eyes with a real meticulous eye for detail and the costumes suit the characters to a tee. The make-up is beautifully done, while the special effects, while not the very best of the show, put many recent shows and films to shame, especially Drogon.One cannot not mention the thematically, orchestrally and atmospherically multi-layered music scoring and the unforgettable main theme. Again, worthy of a high-budget fantasy/action/drama film. The opening credits are beautifully designed. There were hardly any great moments, but did find the very beginning powerful and the Tyrion and Jon chemistry and their big scene also stirred the emotions. The acting was very good considering what was given to them, with the best performance coming from Peter Dinklage, who said his lines with authority while telling a lot with his eyes and face in wordless parts too.Did think that there was an exception, and that was Kit Harington, Jon is dull as dishwater and acts stupidly here and Harington's performance here is indicative of indifference and that he had lost faith in the character, writing and show. It is the writing and story single handedly sank \"The Iron Throne\". The script is far too talky, is very stilted, like very stale soap opera and the worst of it is truly embarrassing. When the most memorable dialogue is in a scene concerning talking about brothels, of all things, you know you are in trouble, found myself truly cringing then. The latter half of Season 8 saw such great characters, complex ones, reduced to one-dimensional caricatures behaving irrationally or out of character. Here they are assassinated beyond recognition, Tyrion (a contender for my consistent favourite 'Game of Thrones' character) especially. And their arcs finishing inconsistently and anti-climactically. The only ones to be in character or so it felt were Ghost and up to a certain point Drogon, am not kidding here.Having shown my dislike of the writing/script here, the story was an absolute mess, with only a couple of decent moments. What should have been emotional and powerful moments, so Tyrion's grief and the part with Drogon as primary examples, were ruined by truly questionable and clumsy lapses in logic that could easily have been avoided, wasting two of the episode's best scored scenes and in the former Dinklage's affecting acting and the latter seeing a rare chance of Drogon being shown to be a non-human character with soul (the build up was promising and then squandered by Drogon's actions in the rest of the scene). The pace was deadingly dull, with much of the first half being uneventful with a sluggish pace and filled with \"get on with it and to the point\" talk, and then it rushed through everything at the halfway point when the writers realised that they still had a lot to cram in, trying to tie up unanswered questions and failing abysmally in doing that. The outcome of the exchange between Jon and Daenerys was predictable from the very start of the scene and throughout there was very little emotional connection, moreover almost nothing made sense with so many inconsistencies, ridiculous parts (with characters getting off lightly) and things happening for no reason at all. As for who was chosen as ruler, that did not ring true or make sense, neither did the reason for it, and felt more of an excuse to finally give them something to do in the season, after being useless for most of it.Summarising, not irredeemable but by show finale standards of such a fantastic show for much of its run \"The Iron Throne\" was an intelligence insulting disgrace and disrespectful to fans. 3/10",

The first half is excellent: following on from the shocks of the last episode, this provides a fitting coda to the show, and the throne room scene is one of the most powerful in the show's entire run. Great acting from all involved in scenes that I had no problem with whatsoever. It's in the second half that things fall apart, with a pat, rushed, happy ending for most of the characters. Arya inexplicably swans off to who knows where; Sansa makes unreasonable demands and somehow gets them accepted; as for the presence of Bronn, and a simpering Brienne, and Sam as Grand Maester - what?! I must have been watching a different show. The best thing about the end of the episode is Ghost's reappearance, which at least satisfied me to some degree.",

Few scenes of this episode are touching; another crazy; few absurde. Expression of good intentions, in same measure, it is bitter - sweet. And it sucks, like each episode of eight season. After its end, as teacher of history, I preserve the silhouettes. Caligula, many mothers of kings, Tommaso Campanella and Niccolo Machiavelli, Giorolamo Savonarola and the deep roots of each of us. In same measure, the Utopic Socialism and the minor price of the lives of ordinary people.The serie ends with the 6 season. The last seasons are parts of a sort of essay, in which the ambition to challenge the public using the special effects for visual shock and to propose a game of absurde and shocking, at the level of young child , is the purpoise. The compensation- I hope the last novels of Mr. Martin. The 8 season is just a house with children when the parents and adult relatives are far by the home.So, a decent end. Hppy, crazy, unrealistic, comfortable and provocative in same measure. Sure, I am not exactly a fan of serie. But I am profound grateful for discover good actors, admirable performances, nice scenes and promissing serie for better sequels.",

My vocabulary in English cannot find a better word to describe the feeling (I believe) of most of the fans of \"Game of Thrones\" after all these years.

The attitude of Daenerys Targaryen in the last episode burning down to ashes King\u00b4s Landing was the opposite the fans could expect from that character. But the attitude of Jon Snow toward the woman that loves him is senseless and absurd. The characters and the fans and even HBO deserved better writers.

                    "content": "The pile-on about season 8 had begun before the final episode had confirmed all the leaks and rumours, and I don't see the need to join it. It was interesting for me to look back on my comments over the last 8 years and see that they did fit with the greater opinion that things started slipped around season 5, and that the rush was evident in particular in season 7. In that season though, it felt very much like the characters were being forced to jump around in time and space to make everything happen that needed to happen but that the show no longer had time to do in a way that made sense. This was problematic, but nowhere near the problems caused by jumping the characters around emotionally - because this is really what kills the season.In terms of plotting, watching it felt like someone telling me the basic plot of a show I don't watch - \"he hates her\", \"she is doing x\", \"they've got to go and do y\"; all of it factually correct but yet I don't have any foundation in the characters so it is really just information more than something I am invested in. This didn't happen overnight, and the rush in season 7 is part of it, but in this season it very much feels like the story was written in bullet-points, without any connection or worry about flowing characters between states. The on-line fighting about it seems to take the side that everything was foreshadowed, or that none of it makes sense at all, but I think it is in the middle somewhere. Almost all of it could make sense if the show had the time to do it, but it doesn't. The result was that I approached the final episode almost like a duty, to tick off the final few bullet-points, which is a terrible way to feel about the final episode of a show that has run for this long and made its mark mostly on the basis of great story-telling.Aside from the character issues, season 8 repeats the 7th's approach of making things happen because they need to happen even if they don't make sense the way they came to happen. These are not as bad as the overall character problems, but they still annoy because seeing the convenience (or laziness) quite so brazenly on-screen tended to break me out of the moment. In terms of the actual production, it remains hugely impressive from a technical and scale of design point of view. The bottles and coffee cups aside, the money is all there on the screen, and the show is at its best when it is only about these things. The scale of the battle sequences are terrific, the cinematography mostly brilliant (but yes, like everyone, I watched that one episode with every light in the house out, and the brightness up as high as possible on the TV), the effects great, sound, music, costumes, locations - all of that remains of a very high standard.Likewise, the cast work with what they are given, and make it work as best they can. Dinklage, Clarke, Harington, Turner, Flynn, Hivju, Coster-Waldau, and on and on - all good, except you have to caveat that by then saying \"despite it all\". So for Clarke it is that the sudden gear change must have been hard for her to sell; likewise for Coster-Waldau. And for Harington his dialogue became so sparse for so many episodes that he must wonder what he did to deserve it - did someone try to Tom Baker his Adric?For all of its scale, for all of the work that the thousands involved in the production put in, for all the spectacle on the screen, in the end it too often feels like a to-do list more than a story. Deaths of major characters, something the show once managed to show us were coming, but yet still took us by surprise, are delivered almost without comment, pause, or reflection, and it all gives us a final episode where almost nothing has an emotional impact, and it peters out before it ends, the final half of the final episode being all the worst of the season, robbed of all the good parts.",

Perhaps it isn't too late but if Daenerys isn't too sit on the Iron Throne who is to rule the kingdoms of Westeros and what will happen to those who opposed her?I know this is a much derided episode but I thought it was a solid enough conclusion to the series. It may have been a bit rushed but it gave most characters a proper ending before they get on with the next stage of their lives. Most people watching will have a personal choice as to who should rule so it isn't surprising that many viewers weren't pleased with the choice... similarly the episode doesn't feature too much action or the 'edgy' material the series became known for. The cast was one fine form and I was pleased to see most of the survivors given enough screen time to bid favourite characters good bye. As it drew to an end I was left wanting to know what will happen next in the hopefully more peaceful times. Overall I'd say that, even though I know I'm in the minority, I enjoyed this conclusion and thank all of the creators for this great series.",

She met Rhaegar Targaryen - Robert got jealous and started the rumors that Rhaegar had abducted Laynna (untrue she left willingly to be with Rhaegar) -- all that led to Robert's rebellion which lead us into the reason for the story: Democracy is now the order of Westeros - it has become a Democratic Oligarchy (still run by a small group of people, but who runs the 7 Kingdoms is now voted on. 7/10",

                    "content": "I can't even begin to count how many hours I've spent watching the show, reading articles, looking for interviews and set photos. Game of Thrones has consumed by life for the better part of the last decade, and now it's over. It's all over. And regardless of what the internet thinks, I think this finale was absolutely perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better end to the journeys of all my favorite TV characters in one hour and a half long night of television. In a divisive and cynical time, I love that Game of Thrones' last big \"twist\" was that it ends in a somewhat predictable and hopeful way.Of course, the episode didn't necessarily start that way, as we see the city in pieces following Daenerys' destruction last week. Watching Tyrion stare Dany in the face, call her out on her BS and throw the Hand of the King pin to the side was brilliantly bold and bada**. If they were going to kill Tyrion, that was a pretty awesome way to end his arc. Luckily, we had a scene with Jon & Tyrion that was just what Jon needed to do what had to be done.I think we all figured Dany's days were numbered after last week, we just weren't sure how exactly she would be killed. It was always expected to be Jon, but having him do it right before she was about to sit on the Throne she spent SEASONS trying to reach, was devastatingly tragic, but absolutely fitting. After all that, ultimately no one gets to sit on the Iron Throne. The next sequence, showcasing all of the Lords of Westeros gathered around Tyrion at first is a bit jarring, but you knew there had to be a nice way to wrap everyone's stories up, especially since there was merely 30 minutes to go. It becomes even more jarring when Tyrion pleads for Bran to be the one to take the Throne, but it all starts to click after that. He is the only one that can't possibly fall into the same sort of poison the throne brings upon everyone who desires it. He is the memory of this world.Drogon takes Dany away, Jon takes the black once again, Tyrion is the new Hand of the King, Sam is grand maester, and Davos, Bronn, Brienne all sit on the new small council. I loved watching Brienne finish Jaime's page in the history of the Knights of the Seven Kingdoms book. Seeing the new small council argue over the small things in the world was fittingly bittersweet. Podrick alive and well and wheeling Bran around! Even seeing Grey Worm going to Naath felt right, though if I was a betting man I could have sworn he would have been toast this season.This show started with the Starks, and I'm thrilled that it ended with the montage of the 3 remaining Starks (we don't count Bran anymore) and their new lives. Sansa as the new Queen of the *Independent* North, Arya going West of Westeros like I hoped, and finally Jon going home, going North. And YES he got his pets to Ghost! It's truly only fitting that we see that one green plant North of The Wall, A DREAM OF SPRING. Thank you Game of Thrones, for everything.10/10",

Actually i highly enjoyed first 43 minutes of it very highly - great cinematography, mood, music and directing - it was all there where it left us in \"The Bells\" (probably my favorite episode of them all). And then the ending came. And i won't spoil anything but i will say it was surprising for me a bit, so say the least - didn't expected that. It was kinda logical conclusion of the events this show brought us to.Anyway, whether you liked it or not (and from 4,7 IMDB rating i see that you didn't), the show has finally ended. I wasn't the biggest fan of it, yet i highly enjoyed it. First 4 seasons were brilliant in my opinion, and last 4 season stared to be a bit predictable and to \"Hollywood'sh\". What this last season needed the most is more episodes - not more battles but episodes that would have fleshed out situation we were into and actions some main characters took.Last thing - no matter how did it ended - i highly enjoyed the show. Thank you very much HBO for an amazing ride and memories, plenty of them, which will stick with me till the end. Great show.",

Seemed modern daytime soap opera like in clearing up romantic hook-ups - hasty & artificial. Major negatives: For seven seasons we have Daenerys portraying a fantasy God like goodness & courage. Season 8, right off the bat, I sensed something wrong when as she enters the city, dragons flying over & frightening people, I see her smirking in a self-indulgent, petty, \"Aren't I great pose.\" Humans are consistent over a period of time as to their personality & values - they don't suddenly turn 180 degrees. More inconsistencies followed. The other discomforting characterization, most all the females were flawed even Arya abandons helping to go off on her own personal quest. Main example is Cersei shown as raised in spoiled wealth; illicit & immoral sex; narcissistic; dispassionately abandons allies; avoided military service so lacks remorse/understanding in her slaughtering innocents - very Trump like for her era. Tyrion sums it up - \"What unites people? Armies? Gold? Flags? - Stories!\". For me, yes stories, thus the final year let 8 seasons of story down.",

The post event of the last episode left everyone shocked with a twist on a character. This episode is about that event and how everyone is trying to resolve with what just happened. It got dark and intense with the opening half of the scene. People walking through a burnt and destroyed King's Landing. The build up suspense in this episode is kind of left disappointing. When it resolves the climatic situation a little too quick with its emotional send off. I predicted with what was going to happen. I loved how it went. There was not much of a battle or an epic climatic fight. All of it was in the previous episodes. With this episode feeling like an epilogue exposition. The new future of Westeros and the direction it can take. There is one shocking WTF scene that is mind blowing that refers back to an earlier season which comes back to this. The last hour of the episode does take itself in a new direction which I did not see coming. And kind of left speechless about it. It does end in the most satisfying conclusion with characters having a full circle with their story arc. Being in the position were they are suppose to be.Overall, Game of Thrones season 8 (5 out of 5 stars). An epic finale of an awesome series which delivered exciting battle sequences, a great complex story with the characters, and it is one fast paced season that messed with your emotions and left you on the edge.",

                    "content": "Or, \"Many partings\"Look at Lord of the Rings: The beginnings of that story are as complex as this, but the end of that tale is very much like the end of this version of \"A Song of Ice and Fire\".And one thing about that ending frightened some people, and that is the concept of \"Democracy\". Daenerys did not like that word, but Jon did. In fact the word did not have very much use in this tale, until this episode. The former Lords of the Seven Kingdoms did not have much use for it either. But of all of the complaints about this ending, that is probably the most prominent. Oh, the word was never used in this series at all. But the underlying concept was part of this episode. And that concept was, \"Which contender for King would have listened to his constituents?\" And the answer to that question is here.I watched part of the very first episode of this series on the night it was first broadcast. I thought, \"Neat, but who needs another show about stuff that happened during the Dark Ages?\" - I did not realize at the time that this was an Alternate Reality, a different world even, where winter does not come every year but at intervals that can't be predicted. I was not interested in this at all, until I was given a free month of HBO one summer, and with nothing else to do, I watched the whole thing.Of course it did not take long for me to get sucked in to Westeros, and like everyone else, I became invested in the story being told, or rather, the many stories about the many people, places, gods, and Priestesses, some that gained power by burning people at the stake or sucking their blood out with leeches. Soon I realized that there was as rich of an alternate history as there is in ay Ur-Fantasy Novels, with the added benefit that George R R Martin is still writing this tale and produced part of this version of it.In the course of this show, a variegated assortment of characters and families had been paraded in front of us - Some of them removed from the story in the first season, others hung in there for a lot longer. But as I watched the last season of the show and then went back and watched key episodes and seasons, I realized that there was a pattern: this show was very populated at the start and there was a lot of dialogue because there were a lot of people having discussions. But each season of the show had less and less of these people talking, many of the main characters were killed off including whole families.We were introduced to two families at the start: The Starks and the Lannisters. There was a 3rd family, the Baratheons, which had a relationship to both Stark and Lannister due to friendship and marriage. But we learned right away of improprieties within the King's own family. As viewers we knew it, the other characters in the show were mostly oblivious to it.We know now that the whole conflict between Stark and Lannister was the result of manipulations by \"Lord Littlefinger Baelish\" - And the tale of his treachery spans 7 seasons. Treachery which spread across all of Westeros, affecting the remaining Baratheon family, the Starks and Lannisters, the Boltons, the Targaryen's, The Freys, even the Ironborn Greyjoys- Every one of them affected by Baelish' original act of Treason and Heinous Murder.We were introduced to other cities, continents and cultures, particularly the Dothraki, led by Khal Drogo, and this was where we got our first glimpse of the disrobed figure of Daenerys Targaryen, sister of Viserys, and we start hearing a lot of talk about Dragons- Until we got 3 of them.MEANWHILE, up at \"THE WALL\", a vast construct of Ice and Magic, we get our first encounter with a \"White Walker\", as we see a whole village of \"Wildings\" slaughtered and then rise from the dead with Blue Eyes. This is our introduction to the Watchers on The Wall, an elite group of men, usually former prisoners, who guard the Realms of Men. Against what?For seven years, we watched the ranks of Westeros thin out. The Baratheons, dead. The Boltons - dead. The Freys, dead. Whole houses, wiped out, either by treachery or by trickery, or by the machinations of Cersei Lannister.It was not extraordinary that at the start, we had complex dialogue, sometimes verbatim to the books this tale is based upon. But what happens, if the writer of the books, has not written any since 2011, and the show still has to move forward?With the significant amount of major characters killed off season by season, and not replaced with new, of course the level of Dialogue was reduced somewhat, which is what happens when you have roughly less than a third of the characters you started off with. And then we had significant story and character development, unlikely relationships between unlikely characters: As we entered into the 8th season, the ranks had decisively been thinned out. So all we really have left is Tyrion with his wisecracks, The Hound and Arya fellowshipping on the taste shared revenge but also mutual respect, and the huge reveal as to the identity of one of the most major characters.And let us not get started in the unfortunate events that brought the Night King his very own pet Ghoul-Dragon.As I view these episodes again and again, I saw the mistakes that were made. Tyrion, smart as he is forgot the very nature of his own sister. And Daenerys had been victorious with every campaign and erringly thought she was invincible with three whole dragons, forgetting twice that Dragons are susceptible to flying projectiles.So my take on this final episode, and this final season has to be this: Even the best stories have an ending, and a denouement. Seven seasons of one of the finest stories ever televised had to come to an end. Was I happy with all of the decisions? No, but I was happy that most of the main plot elements had been solidly wrapped up. From the first to the last, Game of Thrones has delivered one whopping kick in the buttocks after another. I think the level of hurt rump for this season is due to the creators providing plot twists and reversals that did not involve their favourite characters, and I am guilty of that as well. \"The season was sparse, the episodes less complex, the dialogue more simple?\" Naturally, because this is what happens when you start off with 100 characters and end with maybe 20. So no complaints, I got the see most of the show in one sitting, so I'm certainly not going to complain about it.I will admit that as I watched the series, I became invested in it, and of course I wanted to see certain things. That I did not get to see those things? I'm not going to pan the whole season and the showrunners because of it. Because look at what I did see:1-Three Dragons destroying a fleet of Slaver Ships.2-The Watchers on the Wall using a huge scythe on a chain to repel thousands of Wilding Attackers.3-The same Wildings besieged by an Army of The Dead at a port far beyond the Wall.4-Cersei using secreted explosives to destroy the Sept of the Seven and all of the little Sparrows.And the most incredible: Arya becoming one of The Faceless Ones.Not to mention the sheer vastness of the imagery I was exposed to, and to this date I can't tell what was real and what was not. But it was all real I suppose, in some ways.This was indeed, \"Many Partings\"- All stories come to an end sooner or later. But this ending was more hopeful than I expected. An Unexpected King, the coolest people on the Small Council, Samwell Tarly given position as a Maester above all of the maesters that dismissed him, and Jamie Lannister's story finally written in the Book of Knights by the very woman that he Knighted.I'm really going to miss these people.",
