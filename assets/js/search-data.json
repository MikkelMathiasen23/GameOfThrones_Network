            "content": "This project is built on three sources of data. A detailed description of each dataset will be described in the following three sections. . Game Of Thrones Wikipage . The first data source are Game Of Thrones Wikipage, where it was possible to extract the data using their API. The Wikipage contains a section describing each season of the series, where this text contained information of characters being involved in each series. Through the use of regular expressions it was possible to extract characters present in each season. Having extracted the characters present in the series we could again utilize the API to extract and gather information about each character and save this locally. . An example can be seen here: link to charaacter page. Information included in a character page are an image of the character, some basic information including: seasons where the character are present, religion, allegiance, culture, family information, status ie. whether the character are dead or alive. It should be noted that the available information can vary between the characters. . Further information are bibliography, family tree etc. but again it should be noted that the available information can vary heavily. The character pages can be used to find interactions between the characters, but also gather basic information about each character. . The wikipage was used to gather information about each character ie. basic stats such as religion, status, appearances, allegiance but also interactions between the characters. This will be further explained and investigated in the coming pages. Further are the character pages used to investigate words used by the character and also the sentiment. . Another approach could be to investigate all the possible wikipages, but this would involve scraping 4723 pages (at the moment), where a lot of these pages are describing scenes, places and eg. religions, which is not important information about the characters. . The extracted data from the wikipages can be downloaded here. The code used to extract information from the wikipages can be found in the Explainer Notebook. . Character dialogoues . The second data source are character dialogoues which can be found here link. The character dialogoues are based on transcripts, and as all transcripts are not freely available some of them are created by fans. The data are divived into dialogoues for each episode and further which character is speaking. . The data are already cleaned and are ready to use. The data are used for text- and sentiment analysis later in this project. . IMDB data . The last data source are reviews and ratings from the IMDB database. The data are extracted using a python package IMDbPY, which contains the average ratings of each episode based on the IMDB database. The ratings does also contain demographic information such as the age and gender of the ratings. . It is also possible to extract reviews of each episode but only a limited amount of reviews can be extracted for each episode namely 25 as maximum. Another approach could be to scrape the IMDB website, but according to the IMDB webpage this is illegal. Therefore the limited amount of reviews pr. episode are used. The reviews also contain a time-stamp, user-id and rating, but these ratings does not appear to be correct as these are either 0 or 1, which does not correspond to the either the average ratings of the episodes or the text corresponding to the ratings. . The idea is to investigate whether the reivewers text correspond with the average rating of the episodes and also whether the ratings/reviews changes throughout the season/episodes. This is also wished to compare with the sentiments of the character, but more on this later in the project. . The gathered data can be found here [link]. . &lt;/img&gt; Created in Deepnote .",

            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

            "content": "Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
