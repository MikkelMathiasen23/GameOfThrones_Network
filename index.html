<p><h1 align="center">Table of contents of the website</h1>
The website contains 6 sections. The first section <em>The Data</em> describes the data, where it is found, and briefly what it is used for. The next section performs an initial exploratory analysis of the data. The third section performs an analysis of the Game Of Thrones networks describing how the characters interact. The next part performs text analysis of the character dialogoues but also the text from the character wiki-pages. The fifth section detects communities in the network, and perform analysis on these. 
The last section ...</p>
<p>Lastly, the analysis performed throughout the website can be found in the explainer notebook if one want's to dig into all the details. If one want's to replicate the analysis the data can be downloaded in the data section.</p>
